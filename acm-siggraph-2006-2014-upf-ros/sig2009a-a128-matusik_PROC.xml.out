  "content" : "We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with printed samples of a number of measured spatially-varying BRDFs. This function encodes, for each point x on the document?s surface, the ratio of the outgoing light (radiance) in a direction ? o to the incident light (irradiance) from a direction ? i . Our key observation is that, through spatial halftoning of inks, we can reproduce any BRDF within the convex hull of our ink library. More importantly, we free the user from the constraints and tedium of worrying about spot colors and explicit separation into ink layers, thus enabling greater freedom and creativity. Our process ( Figure 3 ) begins with the target svBRDF, as well as measurements of the printer BRDFs: layered combinations of the available inks on a given substrate. We find the ?most extreme? BRDFs present in the document, such that the document is representable as a convex linear combination of them, then map only those BRDFs to the printer gamut. Finally, we transform continuous per-pixel ink weights into discrete halftone patterns, at the same or higher resolution. Our halftoning algorithm (Section 4.2) is inspired by those used for colors, but is adapted for BRDFs and incorporates physical dot-size constraints of our printer. We validate our reflectance printing process using both measured and synthetically generated spatially-varying reflectance functions as input. We show simulations and the corresponding printouts for our pipeline, demonstrating the effects of the BRDF gamutmapping and halftoning stages. Our target is a desktop thermal printer (ALPS MD5500), and our printer BRDF library contains 57 different combinations of inks, foils, and finishes, all captured using an image-based reflectance measurement process (Section 5.2). The prior work for this paper spans two different research areas that have traditionally had little overlap. Second, we describe prior work in appearance representation and perception. Hersch et al. [2007] created gamutmapping and halftoning methods for printing images with custom fluorescent inks: the printed images are invisible under daylight and indoor lighting, but become visible when illuminated with UV light. Most relevant to our work is the method of Hersch et al. [2003], who combined a metallic ink with standard inks to print color images with embedded metallic patterns. Such printed images have locations that exhibit a particular amount of specular reflection. Halftoning: Since it was invented in the early 1850s, physical halftoning has been extensively used in the printing industry for generating grayscale and color images with a reduced number of inks, while appearing similar to the original image. Pang et al. [2008] proposed a global optimization-based halftoning algorithm that minimizes both the color and structural difference between the halftoned image and the original. Measured BRDFs can also be simply tabulated [Matusik et al. 2003], or approximated with factored representations (e.g., using sums of products of lower-dimensional functions) [Kautz and McCool 1999; McCool et al. 2001; Lawrence et al. 2006]. Inspired by this work, Ngan et al. [2006] proposed an image-based metric for evaluating BRDFs and developed a system that allows a user to navigate BRDF models for designing material properties. We leverage these perceptual results in our printing algorithms. Our fundamental representation for the target document is an svBRDF. In this section we discuss our factored svBRDF representation, as well as our curve-based BRDF representation and how we assign a distance metric to it. To address this, it has become common to restrict the possible space of representable BRDFs at each pixel. We choose to use a factored svBRDF model ( Figure 4 ), since it provides a combination of flexibility, accuracy, and space efficiency [Lawrence et al. 2006]. In particular, we have observed that many of our inks are not easily representable using analytic models such as those of Phong [1975] or Ward [1992]. The ability to represent those inks explicitly as bases in the output of our gamutmapping stage is vital, thus strengthening our motivation for using a factored svBRDF. We have observed that in many instances the Sparse Alternating Constrained Least-Squares (SACLS) approach intro- duced by Lawrence et al. [2006] yields such results, and in those cases we simply use the output of SACLS. For each of the target and printer BRDFs, we also desire a compact and flexible representation. Because of physical constraints of the printing process, we restrict the representation to isotropic materials. We find that this representation is sufficient to capture most of the perceived differences between printer and target BRDFs, while remaining compact (we typically use between 32 and 512 samples in ? h , depending on the dataset). Note that our processing pipeline is not specific to ? h curves: we could instead accommodate any other linear (e.g., tabulated or factored) BRDF representation. BRDF Distance Metric: In order to perform operations such as minimum-error projection of BRDFs, it is necessary to have a distance metric. We have compared variants of this metric, using several different environment maps, on our database of printer BRDFs. We find good agreement among the distances computed using different environments, and additionally find good agreement with purely single-directional illumination. It is important to note that this observation no longer holds when considering a greater variety of BRDFs: there is non-negligible disagreement among different environments, and generally poor agreement with directional lighting. In most cases, this requires a gamutmapping step, performed on the entire dataset. In some cases, each of our target BRDFs (i.e., each spatial location of our svBRDF) can be expressed exactly as a linear combination of the printer BRDFs. In many other cases, such a linear combination  is not exact but nevertheless represents a good approximation. In order to simplify the above notation, we have assumed that: ? Each of the f k ( ? i , ? o ) is the BRDF of a particular sequence of inks overlaid on top of the substrate layer. ? The substrate alone is also one of the K ?printer BRDFs. ? ? Except as accounted for above, there is no overprinting. That is, each dot is either printed with one of the ?printer BRDFs? (which may itself correspond to a stack of several actual inks) or not printed at all. These assumptions hold for many modern consumer printing technologies. The reason we formulate (1) as an optimization is to allow for an arbitrary distance function. Of course, when the target BRDFs are exactly expressible as linear combinations of the inks, we can always drive the objective function to zero. When the range of target BRDFs is larger than that of the printer BRDFs, we must perform gamut mapping. Furthermore, suppose we have only two inks, with Target Basis BRDFs After Mapping to Printer Spatial Weight Maps We remap basis materials to the closest ones representable as a convex linear combination of the printer inks, according to the metric in (2). Note that this metric must make a tradeoff between preservation of diffuse color and preservation of the specular peak. Here, the closest match was achieved with a slight shift in hue, particularly visible in the component at right. glossiness of 10% and 50%. Simply mapping each target BRDF to the closest ink would cause clamping, as illustrated in the third column. That is, the BRDFs in the second, third, and fourth rows are no longer distinct, but have been mapped to the same printer BRDF. In contrast, a correct gamut mapping will map the maximum-glossiness target BRDF to the maximum-glossiness ink, and will remap the other target BRDFs to preserve their relative level of gloss. Our approach to gamut mapping is simply to map each basis material of our factored target svBRDF to the closest BRDF representable as a linear combination of printer BRDFs. That is, instead of performing the optimization of equation 1 independently for each pixel, we only perform it once for each target basis BRDF. The spatial mixing maps are retained without change, meaning that intermediate BRDFs will again be mapped to intermediate linear combinations on output. It is for this reason that we rely on a basis produced by either the SACLS or convex-hull k-means algorithms, as discussed in Section 3.1. We note that this approach necessarily maps each target BRDF into a convex linear combination of the printer BRDFs. This is because each target BRDF is, by construction, a convex combination of the target basis BRDFs, which in turn are expressed as convex combinations of the printer BRDFs. We are therefore relying on the fact that the composition of two convex linear combinations is itself a convex combination. Thus, the remainder of our pipeline can assume that all BRDFs will fall within the space spanned by the printer BRDFs. We also note that this approach is computationally efficient (seconds per dataset), since it requires performing the constrained nonlinear optimization only for a small number of basis BRDFs. In contrast, projecting each BRDF independently would result in computation times of hours or days. An example of our mapping is presented in Figure 6 . Note that this stage will not preserve the original BRDFs exactly: some compromise is always necessary. For this reason, it is essential that the user be able to preview the results of gamut mapping, which we pro- vide in the form of renderings of spheres under environment-map lighting (as shown here) or full svBRDF renderings under multiple light directions ( Figure 1 ). Discussion: The gamut-mapping approach we use may be thought of as an analogue of traditional color-mapping algorithms that employ a perceptual rendering intent, with the exception that we adapt to the materials present in a target svBRDF. This has the advantage of maximizing the range of BRDFs that are represented in a printout, but with the disadvantage that the same BRDF may be remapped differently in different target svBRDFs. We utilize a halftoning algorithm in our pipeline to convert the continuous-value printer weight maps into binary maps. Recall that we assume that the term ?printer BRDF? may in fact refer to a layered combination of actual inks, or to the substrate itself. In our experiments, we found that many of the more exotic inks, such as metal foils, impose additional constraints on the printing process. Unlike the similar case of ?dot gain? in traditional printing, the effect is random and is not easily modeled. Therefore, we impose one additional constraint on the halftoning: each printer BRDF must be used in a contiguous spatial ?cluster? of some minimum pixel count c (typically between 8 and 16 pixels). Our halftoning implementation is inspired by the clustered Hilbert-curve error diffusion approach of Velho and Gomes [1991], but adapted for multi-channel halftoning (the original worked only on grayscale images) and strictly enforcing the minimum cluster size c. Our algorithm walks along a space-filling curve, maintaining a cumulative error of the halftoning approximation for each channel. This number may be positive or negative, and we take its absolute value to determine how badly each channel is approximating the input maps: we strive to choose the output that will minimize the approximation error over all channels. We also maintain a ?look-ahead? error, which stores what the approximation error will be in c pixels. Our algorithm begins by looking ahead by c pixels, determining the worst-case approximation error (over all channels) resulting from every possible choice of output pixel. We begin outputting pixels for the channel that results in the lowest approximation error, and continue outputting that channel for at least c pixels. At that point, we examine the approximation errors again to decide whether to continue with the same channel (with no requirement that we output an exact multiple of c pixels: we must simply output ? c contiguous pixels of the same channel) or to switch to a new channel. The algorithm is efficient, requiring only a single pass over the image, and typically takes only a second or two for a full page at 600 dpi. The result of the halftoning pipeline for the oak leaf dataset is presented in Figure 7 . This svBRDF was decomposed into four passes, utilizing the metallic silver, cyan, magenta, and yellow cartridges. Discussion: We chose a halftoning algorithm based on Hilbertcurve error diffusion chiefly for its ease of implementation, as well as its adaptability to multiple output channels and minimum cluster size. We expect the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms, such as the tradeoffs between structured and random patterns, to carry over to the svBRDF setting. We require a printer capable of producing a wide range of materials in order to demonstrate the whole reflectance printing process. Commercial offset printers are capable of producing a wide range of different materials including metallic inks, glossy overcoats, etc. However, experimenting with this printing technology is expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, the range of reflectances available with ink-jet technology is steadily growing (e.g., metallic inks are just being introduced), but it still does not span a range that is sufficiently interesting. Therefore, we have used an older printer model, the ALPS MD-5500 (also sold as the Okidata DP-5000) for validation of our pipeline. The main advantage of this printer is that it can print a wide range of different materials (diffuse, metallics, overcoats, foils, etc.), using a thermal-resin technology that places dots of pigment-impregnated resin onto the paper. The printer is relatively inexpensive (about 800 USD), and we have developed drivers based on the open-source ppmtomd package that allow flexible printing of multiple passes. The ALPS MD-5500 uses a variety of different printer cartridges. Although at most 7 ink cartridges can be loaded at one time, cartridges can be swapped between passes. Therefore, it is possible to print a document that uses all available cartridges. In particular, we use the following 12 inks available from Okidata: cyan, magenta, yellow, black, metallic cyan, metallic magenta, metallic gold, metallic silver, gold foil, silver foil, finish, and primer. In  order to expand the range of BRDFs that can be obtained using this printer, we use combined materials created by successively layering up to 6 inks. In total, we used 57 distinct materials with different reflectance properties (documented in Table 1 and shown in Figure 8). Therefore, the combined material needs to be treated as an additional material in our printer basis, and measured separately. Furthermore, the order of printed layers is also important: printing ink A over ink B results in a different reflectance than printing ink B over ink A. We therefore fixed the order in which inks may be stacked, basing the order on our observations of which inks adhere well on top of which others. In order to minimize the effect of different substrates (different paper types) we always use primer as the first ink layer. This effectively allows us to faithfully predict document reflectance even when printing on different substrates. Traditional approaches for material capture use devices such as gonio-reflectometers, which accurately measure the BRDFs of planar samples for all pairs of incident and exitant directions. Instead, we have used a simpler image-based measurement setup, originally proposed by Marschner et al. [1999]. In particular, we use a cylindrical material sample (i.e., we roll a uniform sample of a printer BRDF around a cylinder). Since each point on the cylinder cross-section has a different normal, we obtain a 1D set of measurements with each image of the cylinder under point illumination. In our setup, illustrated in Figure 9 , the cylinder is 2.9 cm in diameter, and is illuminated by a halogen light-source positioned 4 meters away. A Canon 5D SLR camera is positioned between the light source and the cylinder (about 1.36 meters away from the cylinder), as close as possible to the light path that illuminates the target without interfering with it (the angle between the camera, the cylinder and the light source is approximately 2 degrees). We capture an exposure sequence with 15 images, ranging from 1/2000 sec. The highdynamic-range image of the sample is then reconstructed by using the Mitsunaga-Nayar algorithm [1999]. Finally, we calibrate for the perspective distortion and average the pixel values along the cylinder to obtain the ? h curve. By changing the location of the light source, we could measure curves for other slices of the BRDF (using the terminology of [Rusinkiewicz 1998], those with different ? d ), though the results in this paper use only a single ? h curve. Printed samples of the inks are wrapped around a cylinder, illuminated by a strong halogen light source, and photographed by a digital SLR camera. A gray card visible in each image is used to calibrate for any fluctuation in light intensity. Right: Three crops from images of ink-sample cylinders, illustrating a plain ink, a metallic ink, and a foil. To perform white balancing and absolute calibration, a GretagMacbeth three-step gray card is placed in the scene, visible in every image. By using the same high-dynamic-range image reconstruction process we compute the average red, green and blue pixel values for the gray card and use them as a reference. To determine the absolute reflectance values we make use of the card?s middle (gray) part, which is designed to reflect 18% of incoming light. We have evaluated our processing pipeline on a number of different examples. In particular, we have used two svBRDF data sets from Lawrence et al. [2006]: ?Dove? and ?Season?s Greetings. ? Furthermore, we have captured two additional svBRDF data sets: an ?Oak Leaf? and a ?Rusty Flange. ? All of these data sets contain BRDFs that are not simply diffuse reflection. The ?Dove? data set is decomposed into 3 basis materials. It contains both metallic and diffuse BRDFs. As seen in Figure 6 , the original svBRDF can be represented well with the linear combination of basis inks. Furthermore, the printed output comes quite close to the original material. The ?Season?s Greetings? data set is decomposed into 4 basis materials. This data set is more challenging, since the materials span a large range of specular values. As can be seen in Figure 1 , these linear combinations of basis inks come close to the original, but some inaccuracy relative to the original data is introduced. Nevertheless, despite the errors the printed output closely resembles the original sample. Both ?Oak Leaf? and ?Rusty Flange? are represented using 15 basis materials. When printed, both of these svBRDFs create a strong illusion of viewing an actual leaf or a rusty material. Photographs of the Oak Leaf and Dove are presented in Figure 10, while Figure 1 shows a photo of the Season?s Greetings dataset. All are photographed under point lighting, though the curvature of the paper causes localized highlights to appear. For the Season?s Greetings and Rusty Flange datasets, we have obtained calibrated photographs under carefully controlled lighting conditions, enabling a comparison to the predicted renderings (Figure 11). Discussion: The comparisons show the accuracy we are able to achieve, relative to our predictions, demonstrating that even though we might not always be able to match the original data because of the limited printer gamut, we can offer an accurate preview of the final printed document. Due to the effective output resolution limit (only 150-200 dpi) of the ALPS printer, the printouts have to be viewed from at least half a meter distance. When viewed from closer distance, the half-toning patterns become visible and the material perception breaks down. We believe that using commercial offset printing technologies could alleviate this problem. Another clear distinction from the original measured samples is the inability of our system to reproduce both normal and surface tangent variation, present in the original ?Dove,? ?Oak Leaf,? and ?Rusty Flange? data sets. We have presented a framework for representing and printing documents as spatially-varying BRDFs, approximating the target svBRDFs with linear combinations of printer BRDFs. We have proposed a gamut-mapping algorithm for BRDFs that avoids clamping artifacts and preserves relative differences between reflectances in a printed document. Furthermore, our system allows us to preview documents with arbitrary lighting and view before they are printed. This feature can be especially useful for offset printing, which has higher set-up costs and requires larger runs. In summary, we believe that our framework is an effective pipeline for printing documents with desired reflectance proper ties. This framework will enable creative professionals to control the complete reflectance properties of printed digital documents, smoothly extending upon the capabilities of color-only documentproduction pipelines. This will require representing documents using Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reflection Distribution Functions (BSSRDFs) rather than svBRDFs. This process would require measuring the scattering properties of the substrate, as well as more complex gamut-mapping and halftoning algorithms. Second, current printers can only print isotropic BRDFs. While it is natural to extend our software pipeline to anisotropic BRDFs, physically producing such materials will require using more sophisticated output devices that can embed mi- Target Printout Target Printout crogeometry into printed surfaces. Third, we have only demonstrated printing on planar surfaces. We believe that it is possible to design local gamut-mapping algorithms that locally preserve relative differences between document reflectances in a similar fashion to local tone-mapping operators for high-dynamic range images. ? We believe that technologies such as e-ink are ideally suited for this application, since they would allow switching between different basis materials (with different BRDFs) at each pixel. It is also possible to use spatial multiplexing to accomplish the same goal, by using our current pipeline to print a checkered grid of different materials, then using an LCD panel to expose or conceal pixels of the grid. Figure 12 shows a prototype of such a device, using an off-the-shelf high-contrast LCD extracted from a black-and-white display. This prototype has some limitations, including a limited spatial resolution and the significant amount of light blocked by the LCD, yet suggests that it should be practical to create surfaces with dynamic spatially-varying materials, which would expand the possibilities of material design even more broadly.

Given two BRDFs represented as the half-angle curves f 1 ( ? h ) and f 2 ( ? h ), we use the following distance metric between them: This is derived by considering spheres with the given BRDFs, illuminated by a directional light and observed from the light direction. For a given angle of incidence ? , the irradiance is just f ( ? ) cos ? , where we use the fact that, for co-incident lighting and viewer directions, ? i = ? o = ? h . We take the cube root of this to incorporate a perceptually-based nonlinearity, inspired by the nonlinearity present in the CIELAB color space. Now, we wish to take the L 2 distance between the (nonlinearly-adjusted) sphere images, which requires us to account for the relative projected areas for each ? . This is simply sin ? cos ? .",
