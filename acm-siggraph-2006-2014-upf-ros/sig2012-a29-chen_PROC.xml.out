  "content" : "Inspired by Schelling?s work, we designed a user study that asks people to select points on 3D surface meshes that they expect will be selected by other people and used the acquired data to build a model of mesh saliency. Our primary research contribution is the analysis of the collected data. Our secondary research contributions are the methods used for acquiring, analyzing, and predicting Schelling points on 3D meshes. ? His main finding was that most people select points where the ?contour is most different from a straight line? ? i.e., where the curvature has large magnitude. ,? but also because it asks the question in a different way: ?where do other people select feature points? This approach was a resounding failure. The concept of focal points was introduced in pure coordination game theory in the 1960?s [Schelling 1960] (page 57) ? Schelling found that people asked to make selections that match other people?s selections amongst seemingly equivalent distinct options (segregated Nash equilibria) often make the same choices without any communication or feedback. Inspired by the ideas of Schelling and Lewis, we have designed a method to study semantic salience on 3D meshes. ? (Section 5). Finally, we provide an algorithm to predict a set of Schelling points for new meshes (Section 7). To address this issue, we performed our study on-line. Following the approach of [Chen et al. 2009] and [Cole et al. 2009], we recruited subjects for our study through Amazon?s Mechanical Turk (AMT) [Amazon 2009], an on-line platform that matches people willing to work with paying tasks. Unlike a laboratory study, where a handful of screened subjects are trained, monitored, and employed for several hours, we have access to a much larger number of people, but less control over subject selection and less trust that every individual is motivated to do a good job. Specifically, we presented each user with a 3D mesh shown in an interactive viewer with a crystal ball camera control and a simple method for clicking on points with the mouse (one key for adding a point at the selected position on the mesh and another key for removing a previously added point). Then, we provided the following instructions: ? select points on the surface of a 3D object likely to be selected by other people. ? Our reward structure ranked people according to a scoring function that provides positive credit for each point also selected by at least 25% of other people, negative credit for other points, and zero credit if less than ten points were selected. Based on the ranking, we paid the top scoring 30% of people X, the next 60% X/2, and the bottom 10% were not paid. This incentive structure was chosen based on the results of a pilot study, which suggested that it is useful to provide motivation for people to select more than just the very obvious Schelling points (e.g., the ends of limbs on animals) and that it is better to acquire too many points from people than too few (if a surface has fewer Schelling points, then ?extra? points will be distributed somewhat randomly). Data Filtering: Even though our pay structure encourages people to do a good job, we employ three filters to discard point sets we expect to provide bad data: i.e., when the user: 1) clicks too few points (less than ten), 2) maintains approximately the same camera viewpoint for the entire interactive session (the cumulative camera rotation is less than 36 degrees), and 3) clicks too hastily (the average time per click is less than one second). These filters were chosen on the basis of a pilot study, which showed empirically that a significant fraction of people provided careful data and that these simple filters were effective at conservatively discarding the careless data while retaining much of the good data. In this regard, we designed our filters to favor false-negatives (discarding good data) over false-positives (accepting careless data), since it is easy to collect data on the AMT. This data set contains 400 meshes spread evenly among 20 object categories (human, cup, glasses, airplane, ant, chair, octopus, table, teddy, hand, plier, fish, bird, spring, armadillo, buste, mechanical part, bearing, vase, and four-legged animal), of which we use all but the ?spring. Protocol Implementation: To reduce bias in the acquired data, we implemented a scheduling program that records the AMT identifier and IP address of every subject doing our task. That program ensures that no single AMT identifier or IP address can work on the same mesh twice, that meshes are distributed in randomized order, and that data is provided by approximately the same number of subjects for every mesh. The interactive Java Applet presented to the user for viewing meshes and selecting points is initialized with a random camera direction and two virtual lights, all that point at the object centroid from a distance relative to the object bounding box size. As the user rotates the meshes, the lights move with the camera, staying along the equator at 90 degree angles to the camera. No feedback or payments were made to any subject until all data was collected to avoid training effects. Data Collection: Using this protocol, we used the AMT to acquire 24,124 point sets from 1,696 unique AMT accounts. Of this raw data, 9,965 point sets (44%) from 1,060 unique AMT accounts passed all three data filters ? 16% had too few points, 14% were entered with too little camera motion, and 28% were clicked too hastily. The 9,965 point sets in our final data set contain 201,304 points in total, an average of approximately 10,000 points per object category, 500 points per mesh, and 20 points per point set. Each of the 380 meshes was represented by data from 25 people, on average, and every mesh had at least 23 point sets. To address this issue, we first construct a function on every mesh M that indicates the number of times every vertex V was selected by different people. Then, to reduce spatial noise, we blur that function geodesically with a Gaussian filter with maximal value 1 and ? = 0.01R, where R represents the radius of the mesh (R = p Surf aceArea(M )). The result is a smooth Schelling distribution function, S D (V ), roughly estimating the probability that each vertex V will be selected by a person in our study (shown in red in Figures 1 and 2). To form this set, we select every vertex V with S D (V ) greater than 12.5% and spatial separation by more than 0.02R from any other vertex V k with higher S D (V k ). These choices include at least the vertices that were selected with spatial error less than ? by at least 25% of the people in our study (the positive payment threshold in our study). Some examples point sets are shown in blue in Figure 2 . ,? ?How symmetric are the selected point sets? ? This section takes steps towards addressing these questions. A. How consistently do people select points on the same mesh? The first and most basic question is whether people select points consistently in our study. To address this question, we compute the geodesic distances between points selected by different people on the same mesh. We then analyze the consistency of the point sets by plotting cumulative distributions of d M (P i,k M , P j M ) indicating the fraction of point sets that are consistent with each selected point for a range of distance thresholds. For example, Figure 3a shows cumulative distributions where the horizontal axis represents normalized distance thresholds (d M (P i,k M , P j M )) and the vertical axis represents the fraction of points within that threshold of point sets selected by different people on the same mesh. The thick black curve represents the overall average of all points in the collected data set, aggregated first over all points within the same mesh, then over all meshes within the same object class, and finally over all classes in the data set to avoid over-weighting point sets or meshes with large numbers of points. The thin solid colored curves depict averages for different subsets of the points based on the order in which a user selected a point within his/her interactive session (e.g., the red curve shows distances from the first point selected in each session, the purple curve shows the same for the second and third point, the blue curve for points 4-7, etc. Looking at the curves in Figure 3a , we can readily make two observations. First, different people tend to pick points fairly consistently with one another on the same mesh. Using a normalized distance of 0.05R (approximately 3 inches on a human body) as a threshold to classify whether a point P i,k M is ?consistent? with a point set P j M , we find that 48.5% of the selected points are ?consistent? with other point sets. This level of consistency is far greater than 12.8% that would be observed if points were selected randomly. Second, we observe that points selected earlier in an interactive session tend to be more consistent than ones selected later (there are higher densities near d M (p i , P j ) = 0 in the curves representing points selected earlier), which suggests that people choose the most ?salient? points first, and others later. These results, combined with the visualizations in Figure 2 , suggest that people selected points in a non-random, consistent way in our study. A second question of potential interest is whether people select semantically equivalent Schelling points on different meshes within the same object category. To address these questions, we produced a semantic mapping between all pairs of the twenty meshes within each of the twenty object categories and used those mappings to compute cumulative distributions of normalized distances between selected points. To produce the mappings, an expert user selected a set of landmark points for every mesh that is semantically consistent with every other mesh in the same category. Using these inter-surface mappings, we can study the consistency of points selected by people on different meshes within the same object class. Specifically, for each point P i,k M selected by a person on mesh M , we use the inter-surface mapping M ?M to transfer it to the domain of every other mesh M in the same class to form P i,k M ?M . Then, for every point set P j M collected on mesh M , we compute d M (P i,k M ?M , P j M ), the normalized geodesic distance from the point P i,k M ?M to the closest point in P j M , and add it to the cumulative distributions using the same procedure as described in the previous subsection. The results are shown in Figures 3b. Interestingly, we find that the consistency of points selected by different people on different meshes in the same class is almost, but not quite, as high as the consistency of points selected by different people on the same mesh. Overall, 39.4% of the points selected on one mesh are ?consistent? with point sets selected on different meshes of the same object class. C. How symmetric are the selected point sets? For example, if a person selects the right ear on a head, how often do they also select the left ear? To investigate this question, we manually produced a symmetry mapping from every mesh onto itself to establish dense symmetric point correspondences for each of the 319 meshes with intrinsic reflective symmetry. This was done by clicking on symmetric pairs of landmark points (e.g., right eye to left eye, left elbow to right elbow, etc.) and then interpolating those pairs to form a dense correspondence over the entire surface using an algorithm based on [Bronstein et al. 2006]. Given the symmetric mapping, we analyze the consistency of every point set with its symmetric correspondence using the methods described in the previous subsections ? i.e., we build cumulative distributions of the normalized geodesic distance from every point to the closest point in the same point set after the symmetric mapping has been applied ( Figure 3c ). Our results reveal that point sets selected by people are highly symmetric ? 76.0% of the points are ?consistent? with the symmetric mapping. More specifically, comparing to the histograms in Figure 3 , we find that point sets selected by people are far more consistent with their symmetric mapping than they are with point sets selected by different people. As such, we conclude that symmetry is an important cue for selecting ?salient? points in our study. To address this question, we show the histogram of distances from each point to other points in the same set for meshes of different object class in Figure 4 . The plot shows a separate curve for each of the 19 object classes (dotted lines), along with the overall average (thick red line). Three interesting observations can be made from these histograms. First, people tend to spread points fairly evenly on a mesh ? i.e., there are few points that are either very close to or very far from other points. Second, the spacing for different object classes is different. Third, the spacing of points appears to be dictated more by the size of the mesh shown to the person than the physical size of the object in the real world. Similarly, the spacing of points on a human hand is different if shown alone or as part of an entire body. From these observations, we hypothesize that people think of the virtual objects at the scale they are shown and select the largest features available on the screen regardless of their size in the real world. F. What geometric properties distinguish Schelling points? And, are there other geometric properties of meshes that are associated with Shelling points, but have not been used for point feature extraction before? The set of properties considered includes: ? Curvatures: the Gauss, mean, minimum, and maximum curvatures at V , as computed in [Rusinkiewicz 2004]. ? Mesh Saliency: the mesh saliency at V (at scales 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7), as computed with code provided by [Lee et al. 2005]. ? Geodesic Distance: the average (AGD), median (MGD), standard deviation (SDGD), tenth percentile (10GD), ninetieth percentile (90GD), and maximum of geodesic distance (GGD) from V to all other vertices in M , as estimated by Dijkstra?s algorithm. ? Heat Kernel Signature: the amount of heat diffused from V to itself within time t, for five equally spaced time durations ranging from very small (HKS1) to very large (HKS101), as computed with the implementation provided by [Sun et al. 2009]. ? Up: the Z coordinate (ZPosition) and normal direction (ZNormal), assuming it is prescribed by standards in the modeling language. ? Symmetry: the Intrinsic Reflective Intrinsic Symmetry Axis function proposed by [Xu et al. 2009], per our implementation. ? Segment Centeredness: the centeredness of the point within its part, as computed by first decomposing the mesh into segments automatically with the algorithm in [Shapira et al. 2008] and then computing the distance from V to the closest segmentation boundary divided by the maximal distance to the closest segmentation boundary for all vertices in the segment containing V . Most of these properties have been used before for characterizing saliency and/or generating point sets on meshes. However, we consider two new ones that are specifically motivated by visual inspection of Schelling point sets collected in our study: symmetry and segment centeredness. Thus, we expect that extrema of these functions (e.g., segment centeredness = 1) will be correlated with locations of selected points. This hypothesis is corroborated by the histogram shown in Figure 5 , which plots frequencies of selected points versus segment centeredness (for automatic SDF segmentations, as used throughout this paper: and for manual segmentations provided by the Benchmark of 3D Mesh Segmentation [Chen et al. 2009], which are included only for comparison sake). We find that selected points appear most often at the center of extract parts ? i.e., the rightmost bin of the histogram contains 25% of the distribution. We also consider functions derived from these basic geometric properties. Specifically, we include the difference between minimum and maximum curvature (CurvDiff), which is smallest at centers of local rotational symmetry. We include the absolute value of Gauss, mean, minimum, and maximum curvatures, which are largest at critical points, peaks/divots, peaks/divots, and ridges/valleys, respectively. We also include blurs at four levels (? = 0.01R, ? = 0.02R, ? = 0.04R, and ? = 0.08R) for all properties except HKS, CurvRing, and Geodesic Distance, which are already very smooth. Finally, for every property, p, and function of that property, f (p), we include a percentile transformation, %(p), that encodes the percentage of vertices that have a smaller value within the same mesh. Results for a representative set of properties and functions on them are shown in Table 1 and Figure 6 . Information Gain: The middle two columns of Table 1 show the Information Gain, G(f ), for functions f of several properties p. G(f ) is the difference between entropy of the Schelling point indicator function, S P (V ) and its average entropy conditioned on discretized values of the property f ? higher values of Information Gain indicate a stronger predictor of the Schelling point locations independent of other properties. From these results, we see that curvature is the strongest single cue for feature point selection ? many of the Schelling points are at the tips of protrusions (fingers and toes), which have large positive minimum curvature, and a few are at conspicuous saddle points (e.g., between fingers), which have highly negative Gauss curvature. Other properties commonly used for feature point detection (e.g., Saliency, HKS, and AGD) also provide fairly good predictors. Random Forest Importance: The rightmost two columns of Table 1 show the importance of f as computed by the Random Forests of [Breiman 2001], which estimate the importance of a feature in combinations with others by building a large number of decision trees trained with different sets of properties and measuring the differences between prediction errors with and without each property. It suggests that indeed minimum curvature and Gauss curvature are most useful properties for predicting Schelling points. We note that percentiles (columns 4 and 6) appear more useful for predicting Schelling points than raw geometric property values: e.g., vertices having curvature higher than others on the same surface are more likely to be Schelling points than ones within any specific range of values. Coverage plots: Figure 6 shows stack plots representing the fraction of Schelling points in S ?explained? by extrema of different mesh properties. To produce this result, we extracted the K largest local maxima of each property (K = 14, matching the average size of a point set collected in our study), with maxima spread by at least geodesic distance 0.02R, using the algorithm described in Section 7. Then, for each Schelling point, s i ? S, we considered the surface properties in the order from bottom to top, marking the property with a vote if it is the first to have one of its K largest local maxima within 0.05R of s i . After all votes are cast (one for each Schelling point on each mesh), we average the votes per mesh, and then average the fractions per class (shown in the first 19 bars in Figure 6 ), and finally average those fractions to get a result for the entire data set (shown in the bar labeled ?Overall? on the far right). These results suggest that extrema of minimum curvature ?explain? 56.7% of the Schelling points (bottom blue region on the rightmost bar). Of the remaining Schelling points, 6.7% are explained by Gauss curvature (red); and 9.1% of the ones still remaining are explained by symmetry (IRSA); and so on. Please note that there is variation in the results for different object classes: curvature measures are almost completely sufficient for explaining Schelling points on airplanes, for example; but symmetry and segment centeredness are more helpful properties for explaining Schelling points on teddy bears. Interestingly, approximately 11% of Schelling points are not described by the strongest K local maxima of any property considered. That is, for a mesh M never seen before, we aim to provide a method that estimates the probability that a person would have selected each vertex V of the mesh if it were included in our study ? i.e., the predicted Schelling point distribution, S ? D (V ). That is, given a new mesh M , we could select a set of K similar meshes M i from the collected Schelling point data set, compute a map m i (M ? M i ) from each vertex V j of M to the corresponding vertex m i (V j ) in each similar mesh M i , and then predict the transferred Schelling point distribution S ? T (V ) for vertices of M by aggregating the Schelling points mapped from other meshes: S ? T (V ) = 1/K P K i S P (m i (V )). This method is very simple. This model is simple to implement, since it considers each vertex of the mesh independently, and it can be applied to arbitrary new surfaces. Our implementation for building the regression model is based on M5P regression trees as provided by Weka [Witten and Frank 2005]). This model builds a decision tree that takes in a training set of vertices labeled with the properties described in the previous section along with the observed value of the Schelling point distribution at that vertex. It analyzes this data and builds a binary tree that splits feature space into distinct regions and then fits a linear regression model for S(V ? ) for each region independently. It was chosen for our study because it can fit non-linear relationships between input and output variables (piecewise linear), and it provides an explanation for how the model operates (the decision tree), which is much easier to decipher than most other regression models. As an example, Figure 7 shows the top nodes of a M5P regression tree learned by our system when trained on the sampled data for teddy bears. Examining the tree, it is interesting to note that the top few levels of splits take into account different properties: minimum curvature, symmetry, segmentation centerness, shape diameter, saliency, etc. Overall, this tree suggests that several types of properties can be combined to make better predictions than any one alone. Of course, nothing in our study is dependent on this particular choice of regression model, and we believe that several other alternatives could have been used just as effectively. Results: To evaluate and compare how effectively the transfer and regression methods work, we performed a series of leave-one-out experiments where we utilized the Schelling points collected from people on all but one mesh to predict the Schelling point distribution on the one held out, and then we evaluated the quality of the prediction by comparison to the Schelling point data collected for that mesh. Evaluation was performed by computing the Information Gain between the predicted and actual point set distributions, as in Table 1 . For the first tests, we used vertex-to-vertex maps to transfer Schelling points to the held out mesh M from other meshes in the same object class. Maps were constructed with two different methods: 1) manually by interpolating human-selected landmark corre- Top nodes of an M5P regression tree learned from Schelling points on teddy bears. spondences (TrueMap), 1 and 2) automatically using Blended Intrinsic Maps [Kim et al. 2011] (BlendedMap). Results of these tests, averaged over all 380 meshes, are shown in the top four rows of Table 2 . They suggest that transferring points does not work well, in general, For many classes of objects (e.g., fish, vase, chair, airplane, bird, etc.), different meshes have different arrangements of parts, accounting for the failures of even TrueMap. For other classes (e.g., ant, hand, etc.), computing semantically correct maps between meshes is difficult, accounting for the worse performance of BlendedMaps. We executed two experiments that differ in how the training sets were chosen. In the first experiment (InClass), regression trees were built in leave-one-out style using training data from meshes of the same class ? i.e., the model was trained on 19 out of the 20 meshes in each object class and then tested on the 20th (as in [Kalogerakis et al. 2010]). In the second experiment (OutClass), the regression tree for each mesh was trained only using data from meshes of other object classes. Results of this study are shown in Table 2 . They suggest that regression significantly outperforms transfer algorithms on this data set, even when training is performed only on examples from different object classes. They also show that the regression model combining many surface properties outperforms any single property ? i.e., the highest Information Gain achieved for any single property (GaussCurvature) is 0.211 (second row of Table 1 ), in comparison to 0.257 (OutClass) and 0.341 (InClass) achieved with regression. Visualizations of Schelling point distributions predicted with a regression model trained InClass are shown in Figure 8 . The meshes and color scheme are the same as in Figure 1 to facilitate direct visual comparison. However, they predict tips of protrusions well (corners in the airplane) as well as some subtle features (e.g., centers of eyeglasses, eyes of the bust, belly button of the teddy bear, etc.) that are difficult to recognize with a threshold on any single surface property. For example, surface matching algorithms often start by detecting a set of features and then searching for correspondences between them. Many algorithms are possible to address this problem, including ones that perform a combinatorial optimization over possible candidate sets, choosing the one that maximizes some objective function. However, for the purposes of this study, we choose a simple greedy algorithm that has been used in several other saliency experiments (e.g., [Shilane and Funkhouser 2007]). The algorithm aims to select a set of vertices {V i } that maximizes the sum of S(V ? i ) at selected vertices, subject to the constraint that no two vertices in {V i } are too close to one another. It does so by sorting vertices from highest S(V ? ) to lowest and then repeatedly selecting the next vertex remaining whose position is not closer than a normalized geodesic distance threshold, D, to any previously selected vertex (D = 0.05). This process avoids selecting many points near one another on the mesh and provides an easy way to reduce the point set size by increasing the distance threshold D or terminating the greedy search after a given number has been selected. Results: To investigate how effectively an algorithm can predict Schelling points, we perform an analysis of the similarities of the automatically generated point sets to the ones collected from people. For this analysis, we extract k = 14 points for each mesh (the even number closest to the median of point sets collected from  people) and then follow the general methodology described in Section 5A. That is, we measure the distance from points in our automatically extracted point sets to the Schellling points S P on the same mesh and plot the cumulative distribution with respect to increasing normalized distance thresholds. For comparison sake, we consider point sets extracted with the same algorithm from maxima of every surface property considered in Section 5, and we consider point sets transferred from Schelling points on other meshes within the same class using the mapping algorithms described in Section 6. Figure 9 shows the results. As in Figure 3a , the horizontal axis contains increasing distance thresholds, D, and the vertical axis shows consistency using the cumulative distribution of point pairs whose normalized geodesic distance is less than D. The red curve on top represents the consistency between Schelling points S P collected from people with point sets extracted automatically from the distribution predicted with regression using InClass training. The lower curves represent the best point sets generated with other methods. These results suggest that the points selected by our algorithm from the distribution learned with regression using InClass training are closer to the Schelling points collected in our study than those predicted with other methods. We also find that they are slightly more consistent with the Schelling points than the average point set collected from people, suggesting that the regression and point extraction algorithms for predicting Schelling point sets are effectively relating surface properties to Schelling point locations. As a final test, we investigated the impact of collecting data via the Amazaon Mechanical Turk (AMT) on the main conclusions of our study. Of course, it is not practical to duplicate the AMT experiment exactly in the laboratory, since it would take hundreds (or possibly thousands) of hours to collect an equivalent amount of data. In stead, we ran a small study in which we recruited 30 volunteers through email inquiries to acquaintences and students unfamiliar with our project. Of these volunteers, 20 were male and 10 were female. They span a range of ages: 6 were ? 20 years old, 16 (2130), 2 (31-40), 2 (41-50), 3 (51-60), and 1 (>60). All except four self-evaluate as having at least ?plenty? of experience with computers, but only 9 report having ?plenty? of experience with graphics. Every participant performed the study on a Windows computer with a 3-button mouse. We asked each of the participants to select points on 19 meshes (one selected randomly from each object category) with the exact same instructions and user interface provided on the AMT (substituting the incentive to gain ?points? for selections consistent with others? rather than higher monetary payment). We rejected data from the other users, leaving 474 point sets from 25 participants. Of those, 354 (74.7%) passed all three data filters ? 66 (13.9%) had too few points, 23 (4.9%) were entered with too little camera motion, and 31 (6.5%) were clicked too hastily. This is a significantly lower rejection rate than for the data collected on the AMT. Analyzing the point sets passing all filters, we find that they closely matches the characteristics of data collected on the AMT. In particular, the distribution of distances indicating the consistency of points selected by different people on the same mesh ( Figure 10a ) and the reflective symmetry of points selected by the same user on the same mesh are almost identical to those collected on the AMT for the same set of meshes ( Figure 10b ). Of course, there is not enough data to study consistency across different meshes in the same class, or to study variations within specific subsets of objects. However, all statistics computed for this small, controlled data set closely match those of the larger AMT data set. In this paper, we have described a study of Schelling points on 3D meshes ? i.e., points that people expect to be selected by other people. With an on-line experiment, we gathered 9,965 points sets containing a total of 201,304 points. During both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we find that these points appear mainly at ?semantically stable? positions on a 3D mesh ? e.g., extrema of curvature, on axes of symmetry, centers of segments, etc. We also find that they are selected fairly consistently by different people on the same mesh, and slightly less so on different meshes of the same object class. However, they are selected very consistently on symmetric parts within the same mesh. We have used this data to train an algorithm for predicting the distribution of Schelling point on new meshes and used it in algorithms for feature point detection. For example, Figure 11 shows how a predicted Schelling distribution can guide a mesh simplification algorithm to preserve features with higher expected semantic salience (as in [Lee et al. 2005]). In this case, quadric errors used by QSlim [Garland and Heckbert 1997] were scaled by S ? D 2 learned with regression from InClass examples. Note how detail is better preserved in salient areas. First, it considers only watertight meshes with relatively smooth features, and therefore some of the findings regarding local geometric features may not generalize to polygon-soup models commonly found in computer graphics repositories. Second, it considers only point features: studying line and region features would also be valuable.
