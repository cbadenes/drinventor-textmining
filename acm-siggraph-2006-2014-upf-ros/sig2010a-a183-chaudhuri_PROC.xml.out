  "content" : "We describe shape retrieval and shape correspondence techniques that support the generation of data-driven suggestions, and report preliminary experiments with a tool for creative prototyping of 3D models. appropriate tools, even novices can produce 3D models that match a predefined appearance [Funkhouser et al. 2004]. Our approach to creativity support is motivated by cognitive theories of creativity. For each retrieved library model, our technique identifies components in the model that are not present in the user?s current shape. This is accomplished by computing a correspondence score for each sample point on the library model, indicating the likelihood of it having a counterpart on the user?s shape. Segments of the  library model that have low average scores are presented as suggestions. To evaluate the utility of data-driven suggestions for creativity support in 3D modeling, we have developed a tool for creative prototyping during the formative stages of 3D design. Computational tools can make available a large variety of appropriate solution components to the user, in effect externalizing domain expertise that the user may lack. Even exceptionally creative products, such as Coleridge?s poetry, have incorporated pre-existing material [Boden 1990], and creativity enhancement methodologies often entail enumeration of solution components [Nickerson 1999]. Shneiderman et al. [2006] identify the ?freer exploration of alternatives? as a key characteristic of creativity support tools, and advocate for tools that prioritize ?easy exploration, rapid experimentation, and fortuitous combinations that lead to innovations. ? Computational creativity support research has thus sought techniques for generating customized examples that allow the user to explore the space of possibilities and alternative courses of action. One possibility is to modify the user?s current design according to pre-defined rules and present several such alternative designs as suggestions [Terry and Mynatt 2002; Terry et al. 2004]. Modeling by example [Funkhouser et al. 2004] allows the user to search a model library and assemble desired models from segments of retrieved shapes. The Shuffler system [Kraevoy et al. 2007] allows the user to load a hand-selected set of compatible 3D models and quickly interchange similar parts between the models. The system relies on a compatible segmentation of all models and cannot be used to suggest novel, unexpected additions to the user?s current model. Unlike our work, it relies on the existence of a parametric space from which models are drawn. Our work likewise addresses the open-ended nature of early-stage creative 3D modeling, yet is compatible with existing geometric modeling tools. In summary, no prior work tackles data-driven suggestion of novel components that augment a prototype 3D model. Our method infers suggestions entirely from surrounding context without additional user input, and can present multiple choices, at multiple attachment points, at any single time. The generation of data-driven suggestions imposes two requirements on shape retrieval. Second, since suggestions are derived from components of database models that are not present in the query shape, the search must be robust to clutter. We employ a histogram-based signature that is robust to clutter and is easy to generate and compare. A multidimensional histogram can encode aspects of both a shape?s global spatial structure and its local detail [Ling and Soatto 2007; Ovsjanikov et al. 2009]. Our signature captures the distribution of pairwise distances between every pair of descriptor categories. tograms corresponds to distance between surface descriptor values. We use the shape diameter function (SDF) as our surface descriptor [Shapira et al. 2008]. SDF captures the local thickness of the shape at a sample point, as measured by a ray along the inward normal. The values are normalized to [0, 1] by dividing by the shape?s diameter. In our implementation, each histogram axis is quantized into 32 bins. To reduce quantization artifacts, binned values are treated as low-variance Gaussians and allowed to ?bleed? into neighboring bins. A useful property of this ?descriptor-descriptor-distance? (D 3 ) histogram is its local response to incremental addition or removal of parts of the shape. Since the histogram aggregates n pairs of sam2 ples, modification of a single sample affects n?1 pairs, or O(n ?1 ) of the histogram. A notable advantage of the HIK is that it is well suited to matching objects that are only partially similar, since the intersection operation discards unmatched clutter. In the absence of a standardized scale for all objects, we normalize shapes to the unit cube. Thus if the additional components present in the second shape significantly alter the scale of the object, the above analysis no longer holds. Pyramid matching, described below, is employed in part to compensate for varying scale. Pyramid matching. The similarity of two shapes can be evaluated by examining corresponding histogram values. Such comparison is sensitive to histogram resolution: histograms with too few subdivisions are not discriminative enough, while excessive refinement eliminates approximate matches. To overcome this problem, we use the pyramid match kernel [Grauman and Darrell 2007]. A histogram pyramid consists of a hierarchy of lower-resolution versions of a base histogram, with each successive level halving the resolution of the previous one. The attenuation reflects the fact that these represent approximate matches, with a coarser discretization of values. Two vaguely similar shapes will have a low but positive matching score from higher-level matches, even if their base (high-resolution) histograms are dissimilar. Diversification. A key requirement of shape search for creativity support is the diversity of retrieved shapes. Given a set S of n search results ranked by similarity to the query Q, we diversify this set using the Maximal Marginal Relevance criterion [Carbonell and Goldstein 1998]. The algorithm reorders the set S, yielding a diversified sequence D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D n with increased spacing between similar results. Each subsequent D i is chosen according to the formula\n        D i ? arg max ? sim(D, Q) ? (1 ? ?) max sim(D, D j ) , D?S\\S i?1 D j ?S i?1\n        where S i?1 ? {D 1 , D 2 , . . . , D i?1 } and sim(?, ?) is the similarity measure described above, combining the histogram intersection kernel and the pyramid match kernel. ? ? [0, 1] is a diversity coefficient controlling the degree of reordering. ? = 1 preserves the original ranking and ? = 0 yields maximum diversity at the cost of relevance to the query. We used ? = 0.3 in our implementation. From a diverse set of database models retrieved for the query, our method identifies novel parts that can be used to enhance the initial shape. An interactive application should be able to generate suitable suggestions from a database model, or reject it as unsuitable for suggestions, within a second or two. We use a statistical approach that does not require pre-alignment. The approach computes a correspondence score for each sample point on the database model, indicating the likelihood of it having a counterpart on the query. Correspondence scores are averaged over segments in the database model, and segments with scores lower than a threshold are presented as suggestions. Duplicates of prior suggestions are detected and discarded by comparing their shape signatures. Statistical aggregation over segments stabilizes the approach against individual matching errors. The quality of the local signatures at sample points is still important. We believe, however, that these are easier to develop than general alignment algorithms, and describe an appropriate signature in Section 3.2. To improve the coherence of suggested parts, each model in the library is segmented into components during preprocessing. Our database contains models that are nonmanifold, featuring disconnected faces, seemingly arbitrary disconnected components, and concealed interior structures. This is a common feature of large model databases and calls for segmentation techniques that are robust to such ?polygon soups. ?  Our implementation combines two segmentation algorithms, one based on the shape diameter function (SDF) [Shapira et al. 2008] and the other based on approximate convex decomposition (ACD) [Lien and Amato 2007]. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. SDF isolates parts of a shape that have similar (or smoothly varying) thickness, but is sensitive to internal structure in the shape, such as the seats inside a car. We found the combination of these approaches to be more robust than each in isolation. We first partition the shape using the SDF distribution. For efficiency, and to accommodate badly-tessellated models, we operate on a set of surface points sampled uniformly by area rather than the vertices of the mesh itself. A graph-cut algorithm subdivides this graph into clusters. Adjacent clusters whose union is approximately as convex as the original clusters are recombined. Global reflective symmetry is respected during segmentation [Podolak et al. 2006]. The clustering is converted to a segmentation of the original mesh by assigning to each mesh face the most frequent label of samples in the neighborhood of its centroid. A regularization step smoothes segment boundaries. Local signatures. In order to measure correspondence scores between sample points on a database model and sample points on the query shape, we compute a local signature for each sample point. Signatures for samples on database shapes are computed during preprocessing. To this end, for a sample p on a shape P , we combine a 32 ? 32 spin image S P (p) [Johnson 1997] with a two-dimensional histogram D P (p) that bins samples within a local neighborhood by their SDF value and their distance from p. Spin images have been shown to be effective in robustly capturing the global context of surface points. However, this very robustness makes them insensitive to local detail. On the other hand, the radial distribution of neighbors with varying SDF value is an excellent indicator of local shape, but does not scale well to larger contexts in our experiments. We thus combine these components. Note that both components of the signature are histograms. Given a sample p on a shape P and a sample q on a shape Q, their level of correspondence is defined as cor(p, q) ? sim(S P (p), S Q (q)) ? sim(D P (p), D Q (q)), where sim(?, ?) is the histogram similarity measure described in Section 2, combining the histogram intersection kernel and the pyramid match kernel. Efficiency. The complexity of a na?ve computation of cor P (q) for all sample points q on the query shape grows quadratically, since the correspondence measure cor(p, q) must be computed for all pairs of samples p, q. To combat this prohibitive performance cost, we use high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search techniques. This is non-trivial, since the distance metric sim(?, ?) is a combination of two histogram similarity measures (the histogram intersection kernel and the pyramid match kernel), and operates on histogram vectors with hundreds of dimensions. A natural choice for approximate nearest-neighbor search in spaces with hundreds of dimensions is locality sensitive hashing (LSH) [Indyk and Motwani 1998]. Traditional locality sensitive hashes are restricted to L p metrics or inner products. Our boosted similarity function clearly satisfies the Mercer condition, since it is the product of known Mercer kernels [Odone et al. 2005; Grauman and Darrell 2007]. To leverage this property for efficient evaluation of the correspondence score for a sample point, we wish to construct a hash function that implicitly exploits the Mercer condition without requiring the actual embedding into a higher-dimensional (or infinite-dimensional) space to be constructed. To this end, we employ kernelized locality-sensitive hashing, which extends LSH to Mercer kernels [Kulis and Grauman 2009]. Since the correspondence score for each sample point can be evaluated independently of the others, the computation is trivially parallelizable. We first present timings for various steps in the suggestion generation pipeline. Performance data was obtained on an 8-core 2.53 GHz workstation. For shape retrieval, it took 0.047 milliseconds to compare two D 3 signatures on a single core. Performance scales linearly: total shape retrieval time is 0.056 seconds (excluding I/O) with a library of 1193 models. Correspondence computation, with precomputed signatures at 3,000 sample points per shape, took 0.3 seconds per pair of shapes, averaged over 1,409 such pairs. The standard deviation was 0.23 seconds. We used three 30-bit hashtables on a kernel matrix of 20 signatures to prune 87% of the search space on average, with an approximate nearest neighbor found 84% of the time with 6% error. Over the same set of shapes, it took an average of 0.4 seconds to process and reject a retrieved database model when it did not contribute valid suggestions. (This includes the correspondence computation time above.) It took 0.83 seconds to process a retrieved model from which suggestions were accepted. The longer times are due to slower correspondence computation for similar models, and the pruning of similar suggestions. Extrapolating suggestions from the set of surface samples to the underlying mesh (which frequently had >50,000 faces) took an additional 1.62 seconds on average. Figure 3 shows the highest-ranked suggestions produced for various query shapes. Figure 4 shows suggestions produced for an ambiguous shape that does not naturally lend itself to interpretation. To examine the use of data-driven suggestions by 3D artists, we have created a prototyping tool using the techniques presented in this paper. The tool, dubbed InspireMe, lets an artist request suggestions for a rough initial shape. This allows the artist to visually mock up a prototype and then export it to a high-end 3D modeling package for refinement and texturing. The InspireMe interface is shown in Figure 5 . InspireMe displays suggestions from 12 automatically retrieved and diversified library models, based on the finding that designers prefer to be shown roughly 10 examples [Lee et al. 2010]. The suggestions are highlighted to increase their visual saliency [Treisman and Gelade 1980]. The artist can add any of the suggested parts to the query shape. The initial placement of the added suggestion on the query shape is computed automatically, as described below. This initial placement can be refined by translating, rotating, and scaling the added suggestion in relation to the query shape. Any number of suggestions can be added and removed, supporting rapid visual exploration of possible designs. Suggestions that are not useful can be discarded with a mouse click, and a new set of suggestions is automatically generated from a library model with a lower shape retrieval score. An entirely new batch of suggestions can be requested for a newly assembled composite shape. In this way, the user can mock up increasingly refined prototypes. Placement and gluing of suggestions. When the user chooses to add a suggested part, InspireMe computes an initial attachment point for it, which the user may subsequently fine-tune. Our implementation uses the 4-PCS algorithm with 1000 iterations [Aiger et al. 2008]. When both models are detected to have planes of symmetry, we employ an optimized variation of the algorithm that aligns the models based on the symmetry plane and two widely separated points. Once the part is in place, InspireMe enables simple gluing of proximal surfaces. Each vertex on the suggested part that is within a threshold distance of the query shape is displaced towards its nearest neighbor on the latter. The displacement magnitude falls off with distance, and the displacement field is regularized over local neighborhoods by convolving with a Bartlett filter. A more advanced implementation could utilize high-quality gluing techniques [Sharf et al. 2006]. To evaluate the effectiveness of creativity support with data-driven suggestions, we invited twelve 3D artists to test our prototype implementation. Three of the users were university-level art instructors and professional artists, eight were art students, and one was a computer science student and hobbyist 3D modeler. Ten of the participants had to travel to the lab from a different municipality and were compensated for their time. The users were given two open-ended modeling tasks designed to mimic assignments tackled by 3D artists. A few users who were only available for a short time were assigned only one of the tasks. The two tasks were:  Aircraft You are an artist designing futuristic military aircraft for the upcoming sci-fi film Colony 2130. These will be used in a large extraterrestrial battle scene. Several types of craft are required, such as a large mothership, attack bombers, lowaltitude strafe fighters, search-and-rescue craft for evacuating injured soldiers from alien jungles, etc. Conceptualize and create a mockup design for one such aircraft. Creature You are a creature designer for the upcoming sci-fi film Avatar 2. This sequel will feature Pyrrha, the sister-planet of Pandora from the original film. The dense jungles of Pyrrha teem with fantastical creatures. Conceptualize and create a mockup design for one such creature. In the beginning of each session, we provided a brief overview of the InspireMe interface. Models were transferred between InspireMe and other applications using a shared folder. InspireMe simultaneously ran queries on two databases, Digimation ModelBank (1,193 models) and Digimation Archive (11,461 models with >1,500 faces). Models created by the artists during these sessions are shown in Figure 6 . Note the rudimentary starting shapes, and the fleshed-out concepts in the final mockups. The mockups feature little sculpting beyond basic assembly (and occasional duplication) of suggested parts, which constitute by far the bulk of the transition from query to concept. Figure 7 visualizes the artists? activity during the modeling sessions. Activity time was determined from system logs. The artists frequently worked with modeling programs and InspireMe in parallel, sometimes refining a composite model in Maya while InspireMe was searching for new suggestions. When it was clear from the first page of suggestions that the tool was confused by a particularly ambiguous query model, the artists usually quickly refined it to add more context (such as adding wings to a hull) and submitted a new query. This accounts for the occasional rapid switches of activity between the modeling software and InspireMe. In one instance, an artist decided to experiment by seeking to enhance a finished, production-quality model that he had constructed earlier. He was pleasantly surprised when InspireMe quickly made a few suggestions that could enhance his model and still maintain a coherent yet unusual shape. The initial and final models are illustrated in Figure 8 . User feedback. A professional concept artist suggested that InspireMe would be useful for a local company specializing in the creation of concept art for film and games, further commenting that the tool fits naturally into the production workflow of concept artists. One suggestion for improvement was to add the ability to select a suggestion and request ?more like this,? or reject a suggestion and request that similar ones be suppressed. Artists also suggested automatically remeshing the suggested components to match the tessellation characteristics of the query shape. This work leverages statistical geometry processing techniques to enable a data-driven approach to creativity support in 3D modeling. The suggestion generation method introduced in this paper is compatible with traditional geometric modeling tools. More broadly, the development of datadriven techniques that support open-ended design tasks is a challenging research direction that can advance three-dimensional content creation. The most significant limitation of the presented technique for suggestion generation is its purely geometric nature, which does not take into account the meaning and function of the suggested components. Recent advances indicate the feasibility of semantically labeling components in large collections of three-dimensional content [Kalogerakis et al. 2010]. Utilization of semantic information can substantially increase the effectiveness of suggestion generation. More generally, reasoning about the semantics of shapes and their components can advance the power of data-driven tools for three-dimensional content creation. Finally, the effectiveness of data-driven content creation tools is closely related to the quality of the available data. Existing 3D model libraries are still limited in their extent, fidelity, and availability. On the other hand, the Web has already been used for collaborative creation of extensive image libraries, with millions of freely available, ranked, labeled, high-quality photographs [Flickr 2010]. Large-scale collaboration can similarly enable the construction of comprehensive and detailed databases of three-dimensional content. Such databases can drive the development of new kinds of tools for three-dimensional content creation.
