  "content" : "Different from the existing work, our surface tension force can handle large surface tensions in a realistic way. By using our forces, modeling surface tension and adhesion effects do not require involved techniques such as generating a ghost air phase or surface tracking. We demonstrate that combining both forces allows simulating a variety of interesting effects in a plausible way. First of all, for the particles that are inside of the fluid, normalizing the smoothed color gradient can result in arbitrary normals for inner particles. For large surface tensions, such structures do not easily break as using attraction forces alone does not minimize surface area of the fluid, but strengthens the already existing structures. Furthermore, a nice comparison of the method to [Becker and Teschner 2007] is given in the paper for the experiment where a cubic droplet deforms to a sphere. First of all, the employed surface tracking scheme may fail to detect isolated fluid pieces in regions where the mesh resolution remains coarse; this prevents generating surface tension for such areas. [Steele et al. 2004] proposed a fully Lagrangian approach for the simulation of viscous liquids, including adhesion to solids. After this step, fluid to solid adhesion is generated using an XSPH based artificial viscosity term. We present a surface tension force and a fluid-solid adhesion force for the improved treatment of fluid-air and fluid-solid interfaces in SPH fluids. Our surface tension approach can handle large surface tensions by minimizing surface area in all scales while conserving momentum. Furthermore, our surface tension force also generates repulsion forces for close distances, which prevents the particleclustering problem at the free surface without requiring additional treatment such as generating ghost air particles or artificial pressure forces. Our adhesion force allows physically plausible solid-fluid adhesion effects without requiring additional handling such as ghost SPH. Furthermore, our approach allows simulating interesting phenomena such as different wetting effects and two-way adhesion. Both of our forces can be easily added to an existing SPH solver as additional force terms without any extra effort. For instance, when pouring water into a glass, the force that keeps liquid molecules together is the surface tension force. Inside the fluid, each molecule is pulled equally by its neighbors, resulting in a zero net force. However, as the free surface does not have neighbors on all sides, the molecules in such regions are pulled inwards. Adhesion allows fluids to get attracted by other materials. For instance, the unique appearance of dew on plants and the ability of water striders to stay atop water are caused by the interplay of surface tension and adhesion forces. For this reason, either a density correction technique [Shepard 1968], or simply not allowing negative pressures are other common practices for avoiding tensile instability. [Akinci et al. 2012b] addresses this issue for fluid-solid interface by pre-computing a single layer of boundary particles for the solid boundaries, which also extends to two-way fluid-solid coupling. In [Schechter and Bridson 2012], ghost SPH particles are dynamically generated at both fluid-solid and fluid-air interfaces. However, neither of the methods is capable of simulating some important real world scenarios such as different wetting effects. Furthermore, the effect of adhesion forces on the solids is neglected in both works. Our surface tension and adhesion schemes are the first to meet all these requirements, and allow plausible simulations of variety of effects that emerge in reality. Additionally, our surface tension force avoids particle clustering at the free surface without generating ghost air particles using [Schechter and Bridson 2012] or artificial pressure forces [Monaghan 2000]. In the remainder of this section, we first discuss existing works that model surface tension and adhesion effects in fluid animation with an emphasis on SPH fluids, and then we highlight the benefits of our techniques in comparison to the existing work. Surface tension in liquids arises as a result of molecular cohesion. When only cohesion forces are applied between particles, the neighboring particles just attract each other which can result in any arbitrary  configuration depending on the initial configuration of the particles (see e.g. Figures 2a, 2b). Additionally, we also experienced that only using curvature minimization terms [Morris 1999; M?ller et al. 2003] results in more severe particle clustering for the experiment depicted in Figure 2 , causing the droplet to break into many smaller droplets. To address these issues, we propose a new surface tension force that takes both molecular cohesion and surface area minimization into account and allows handling large surface tensions properly (see Figure 2c ). However, we observed that the function used in [Tartakovsky and Meakin 2005] results in clustering throughout the fluid (see Figure 2a ). However, since the method lacks a repulsion term, it also results in severe clustering; especially in regions with underestimated pressures (see Figure 2b -right). The forces applied by those two methods for a support radius h = 1 can be seen in Figure 3 . Because of the issues with the existing cohesion forces, we propose an alternative cohesion force defined as: where i and j are neighboring fluid particles, m denotes mass and x denotes position of the respective particle, ? is the surface tension coefficient and C is a spline function that we created for a 3D SPH simulation as: The term h 9 in the denominator of (2) is a normalization factor to make the force result in the same acceleration for different support radii (e.g. like the SPH pressure force). The constant term in the beginning of (2) is basically used to shift the practical ? values close to 1. Similar to [Tartakovsky and Meakin 2005], our cohesion force also has both a positive and a negative part to result in repulsion (see   Figure 3 ). For the attraction term, we chose a maximum around the particle rest distance h/2, where the attraction smoothly vanishes to 0 until the support radius h. For fluid neighbors closer than the rest distance, the force smoothly decreases to a negative value, which results in repulsion forces for the particles that are too close to each other. Furthermore, both the attraction and repulsion forces behave like a Gaussian to avoid clustering, which is in contrast to [Tartakovsky and Meakin 2005]. Additionally, our repulsion force does not vanish to 0 for close neighbors, which prevents particle clustering in regions with underestimated pressures (see Figure 2c ). Our cohesion term also has similarities to the Lennard-Jones potential [Jones 1924], which is a commonly used model to approximate the interaction between a pair of molecules. Although our cohesion force solves some important issues of previous cohesion models, it is still not sufficient for minimizing the fluid surface area because of the reasons we discussed previously. Therefore, we use an additional force term to counteract surface curvature to minimize the surface area. At this point, we use the fact that the magnitude of n i is proportional to the curvature, where its value is close to zero for the inner parts of the fluid, but large at the free surface proportional to the curvature. We utilize this information and finally create a symmetric force as: One can easily confirm that (3) is zero in flat regions (as n i ? n j = 0) and inside the fluid (as n i ? 0 and n j ? 0), but it gets larger as the curvature increases. Therefore, our surface area minimization force avoids two important issues of previous techniques: Normalization of n i (that is erroneous inside the fluid), and explicit curvature computation (that is very sensitive to particle disorder). In SPH, however, particles represent macroscopic volumes of the fluid. If we consider the simple example of two neighboring particles, the net attraction force that affects each particle is smaller than in a configuration of three neighboring particles, which makes the two particles separate easier than the three particles in the case of external forces. This error in SPH manifests itself as too many isolated particles, since particles with smaller neighborhood get isolated easier than the rest of the fluid. There exist techniques to address this issue, such as corrected SPH (e.g. [Belytschko et al. 1998])  and adaptive SPH [Shapiro et al. 1996]. However, these works add too much computational overhead to basic SPH. Although [Monaghan 2000] (also used in [Macklin and Mueller 2013]) implicitly addresses this issue by generating a spurious surface tension, such an approach is not desirable for our purposes since it would interfere with our refined surface tension model. We provide an explicit solution to this problem by creating the following symmetrized cor- Therefore, K ij amplifies forces for the particles with neighborhood deficiency, while the forces remain the same for the particles with appropriate neighborhood. The final surface tension force can be written as: Note that the terms in (5) are fully symmetrized, and the total force is applied to the particle pairs. The effect of combining both terms can be seen in Figure 2c . Note the large surface tension possible with our approach. We also observed that using larger surface tension forces with the cohesion-only models does not further improve the quality of the generated surface tension behavior, but only results in stiffer fluids with similar spurious structures. In our work, we focus on twoway fluid-solid adhesion in SPH simulations. For boundary handling and two-way fluid-solid coupling, we use [Akinci et al. 2012b], where solid surfaces are sampled using boundary particles. Therefore, the approach addresses the sticking problem of SPH near solid boundaries, and allows two-way fluid-solid coupling with different slip conditions. Adhesion effects, however, are not addressed in [Akinci et al. 2012b]. In our work, we compute adhesion forces between the fluid and the boundary particles as: where k denotes boundary particles, x denotes position of the respective particle, ? is the adhesion coefficient and A is a spline function that we created for a 3D SPH simulation as: Similar to our cohesion force, the term h 3.25 in the denominator of (7) is a normalization factor to make the force result in the same acceleration for different support radii. The scalar term in front of (7) is used to be able to select ? values in the similar range of ? values, where ? ? ? models a moderate hydrophilic behavior. Since the boundary forces used in [Akinci et al. 2012b] already prevent clustering near the solid boundaries, we designed our adhesion force to only attract particles with distances between h/2 and h. Furthermore, we tried to make our attraction force large in this interval, while keeping the force continuous (see Figure 4 ). Initially, we started with a Gaussian-like shape for the adhesion force. Finally, we came up with such a steep parabolic function, which generates strong attractions for most of the neighboring fluid particles. Note that similar to our surface tension force, our adhesion force is also fully symmetric, where F k?i adhesion = ?F i?k adhesion . Our adhesion force allows simulating interesting scenarios, such as different wetting conditions and two-way adhesion. We use [Solenthaler and Pajarola 2009] for computing SPH pressures. However, our surface tension and adhesion forces can be integrated into any SPH solver (e.g. [Becker and Teschner 2007; Bodin et al. 2011; Macklin and Mueller 2013; Ihmsen et al. 2013]) since the forces are computed from the particles and are directly applied to the neighboring pairs. Furthermore, we do not apply pressure forces that arise from negative pressures. For time-step selection, we use the adaptive scheme in [Ihmsen et al. 2010]. We use the artificial viscosity model described in [Monaghan 2005] both for fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions as done in [Akinci et al. 2012b]. Because of the particle deficiency related reason highlighted in Section 2.3, we also multiply viscosity forces with (4). We use the cubic spline kernel function [Monaghan 2005] for our SPH simulations. For SPH neighborhood search, we use the compact hashing technique explained in [Ihmsen et al. 2011b]. If not stated otherwise, we used ? = 1 for all experiments to mimic the surface tension of water. Furthermore, we used ? = ? to model moderate hydrophilic interactions. In all of our simulations, we kept fluid compressibility below 0.1%. Depending on the scale of  the simulated setting, we used different particle radii r, where the particle spacings and support radii were 2r and 4r respectively. We used very low artificial viscosity for the simulated fluids (? 0.01) to mimic the viscosity of water. We reconstructed the fluid surfaces using the efficient implementation explained in [Akinci et al. 2012a]. The renderings were performed using mental ray [ NVIDIA ARC 2011 ]. All simulations and renderings were run on an Intel Xeon X5690 with 16 GB RAM. For the presented scenes, the average simulation time per frame was between 0.1 to 15 seconds, depending on the complexity of the scene, where several simulations steps were computed for each frame. In this section, we demonstrate the versatility of our surface tension and adhesion models in different simulation scenarios. Our experiments show plausible fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions, even at the scale of a single droplet. To show that our approach can handle realistic fluid-fluid interactions, we dropped a 6.5 cm 3 fluid droplet into a 15 ? 4 ? 15 cm 3 container filled with 1M fluid particles ( Figure 1 ). After the fluid droplet hits the main fluid body in the container, a realistic water crown emerged. Also note how the splashes form spherical droplets with various sizes, which is a phenomenon observed in reality. Note both the thin features around the crown and the smooth fingerings that emerge at its top. With the previous surface tension models that are only based on cohesion, the experiment reveals many spurious fluid structures (see Figure 5 ). Our next experiment shows that, by using our surface tension and adhesion models, it is possible to simulate the impact of a large fluid droplet on a solid object in a realistic way. A 0.5 m 3 water volume consisting of 100K fluid particles was dropped on a 1.5?0.12?1.5 m 3 solid ( Figure 6 ). The adhesion of solid was chosen as ? = 0.6 to model a reduced hydrophilic behavior. Because of the surface tension, sheets of fluid broke into fingers, which then transformed into spherical droplets ( Figure 6 middle-left). The adhesion of the table resulted in sliding droplets dripping from the side of the table ( Figure 6 middle-right). Furthermore, the adhesion prevented the fluid to completely merge to a single water body at the end ( Figure 6 right). In the next experiment, we show how the combination of our surface tension and adhesion forces can be used to simulate a scenario where a vertical water stream realistically flows over a sphere with diameter 5 cm ( Figure 7 ). There were up to 50K fluid particles in the scene. We are able to simulate such vertical flows with solid adhesion realistically without requiring ghost SPH. In another experiment we show that by using different adhesion and surface tension constants (where 1 ? ?, ? ? 0.001) , we were able to simulate different wetting conditions in the same simulation scale between no wetting up to perfect wetting for a 1 cm 3 fluid droplet consisting of 750 particles (see Figure 8 ). We created our next experiment to demonstrate how fluids react differently to two solid objects with different adhesion in the same environment ( Figure 9 ). In this scene, a 1 cm 3 water droplet consisting of 4K particles was resting in a highly hydrophilic box with ? = 2. Afterwards, another object with zero adhesion split the droplet into two parts. Note how the droplet sticks to the box, while its contact area with the splitting object remains small. In our final experiment, we show how two-way adhesion force can be used to create interesting scenarios ( Figure 10 ). In this scene, we dropped a 27 cm 3 fluid droplet consisting of 14K particles with ? = 3, on an inclined plane. The plane had ? = 1.2 to make the droplet create a large contact angle with the plane. Additionally, we set the viscosity of the inclined plane to 1 (which was 0.01 in the other experiments). Such a large viscosity makes the droplet roll on the surface, instead of slide. In this experiment, we also dropped ragdolls on the fluid droplet with a density two times larger than the fluid density. This experiment also shows that large surface tension forces prevent the solid to penetrate into the fluid, which is a phenomenon observed in nature. Furthermore, pink ragdolls (with ? = 1) stick to the droplet, whereas the green ragdolls (with ? = 0) bounce and slip from the droplet. In the presented experiments, when the surface tension is the dominant force acting on a particle, time steps are limited by the surface tension. This was the case for some of our experiments that were performed in droplet scales. However, for most of the larger scale experiments, the pressure force was the dominant force. However, as we used the adaptive time stepping scheme explained in [Ihmsen et al. 2010] that also takes the total force on a particle into account, we did not run into stability issues when performing our experiments. In reality, surface tension arises because of cohesion forces between fluid molecules of the same fluid phase, independent of what is beyond the free surface (e.g. air, another liquid or vacuum). Therefore, modeling surface tension does not require an explicit second fluid phase. One ubiquitous effect that arises in reality because of multi-phase interactions is air bubbles inside fluids. Since simulating density ratios in the order of ? water /? air would require considerably more computational effort, there exist alternative air bubble generation techniques to avoid multi-phase simulations (e.g. [Hong et al. 2008; Ihmsen et al. 2011a; Busaryev et al. 2012]). We believe that the realism of our results can be further improved by using such a method. Recently, [Yu et al. 2012] demonstrated that sub-particle scale capillary waves that are directly simulated on the fluid surface mesh can add a significant amount of detail to an existing simulation. We believe that our results would further improve by using their surface tracking and capillary wave simulation approach. We presented a new surface tension force and a new fluid-solid adhesion force to improve the handling of fluid-air and fluid-solid interfaces in SPH simulations. Our surface tension force allows simulating large surface tension, minimizes surface curvature, addresses  the particle-clustering problem in SPH, and conserves momentum, all at the same time. Our adhesion force allows physically plausible fluid-solid adhesion effects, including symmetric adhesion, and can be used to model different surface wettings. Furthermore, our forces can be easily added to an existing SPH solver. Combining both forces allowed us to simulate a variety of interesting scenarios that have not been shown in the graphics literature yet. We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments.
