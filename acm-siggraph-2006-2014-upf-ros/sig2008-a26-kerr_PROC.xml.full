Kerr Dartmouth College direct indirect paint-all\n      Lighting design is a complex but fundamental task in computer cinematography, involving the adjustment of light parameters to define final scene appearance. Many user interfaces have been proposed to simplify lighting design. They can be generally categorized in three paradigms: direct light parameter manipulation, indirect light feature manipulation (e.g., shadow dragging), and goal-based optimization of lighting through painting. To this date, no formal evaluation of the relative effectiveness of these paradigms has been performed. In this paper, we present a first step toward evaluating the benefits of these three paradigms in the form of a user study with a focus on novice users. 20 subjects participated in the experiment by performing various trials on simple scenes with up to 8 point lights, designed to test two lighting tasks: precise adjustment of lighting and the artistic exploration of lighting configurations.

Paint-based goal specification was found to be significantly worse than the other paradigms, especially since users tend to sketch rather than accurately paint goal images, an input that painting algorithms were not designed for. We also found that given enough time, novices can perform relatively complex lighting tasks, unhindered by geometry or lighting complexity. Finally, we believe that our study will impact the design of future lighting interfaces and it will serve as the basis for designing additional experiments to reach a comprehensive evaluation of lighting interfaces.\n      \n        1 Introduction\n      \n      Lighting is a fundamental aspect of computer cinematography in establishing mood and enhancing storytelling [Calahan 1999]. Lighting design, the process by which artists place lights in the scene to achieve a final look, is a complex and labor intensive process. Expert lighters often take days to carefully light a shot in feature film animation. More importantly, novice users are often not capable of effectively lighting complex scenes since they lack the technical training required to efficiently manipulate lights. Various user interfaces have been presented to address the complexity of the lighting design task for novices. Focusing on the editing of point lights, we categorize these interface implementations into three main lighting design paradigms: direct light parameter manipulation, indirect light feature manipulation, and goal-based optimization of lighting through painting. Each of these interfaces rep resents a different metaphor for lighting design. The workflow of direct and indirect interfaces is fundamentally one-light-at-a-time, by selecting and adjusting individual lights. Direct interfaces involve direct modification of the light source; these are common interfaces used in commercial software such as Maya [Autodesk Inc 2009] and Xsi [Autodesk Inc 2008]. Indirect interfaces consist of click-and-drag modifications of lighting features such as position and size of shadows, hotspots, and highlights [Poulin and Fournier 1992; Pellacini et al. 2002]. Painting interfaces are fundamentally different in that they use an optimization algorithm to adjust the parameters of potentially all lights, minimizing the difference between the rendered image and a user-painted one [Schoeneman et al. 1993; Pellacini et al. 2007]. To this date, no formal evaluation of these paradigms has been presented. This paper presents a first step toward quantitatively evaluating the relative effectiveness of these interface paradigms. We specifically focus on novice users with no prior experience in lighting, since they are the majority of potential users and since they receive the most benefits from the introduction of intuitive interfaces. Out of the broad scope of lighting design, we focus our attention on the manipulation of a small number of point light sources in relatively simple scenes, rather than attempting to evaluate how subjects manipulate the hundreds of lights used in complex computer cinematography environments. We focus on this simplified lighting task to ensure that it is manageable for novices. We perform a user study with 20 novice subjects, testing four user interfaces: direct, indirect and two variations of painting. We chose to evaluate two variations of the latter to validate whether the claimed benefits of this paradigm come from the ability to specify the lighting goal via a natural painting metaphor or the ability to work with all lights concurrently. Our study consists of three parts. First, in three matching trials, we ask subjects to manipulate lighting configurations to match exact target images, allowing us to measure the effectiveness of each interface in performing lighting adjustments. Second, in two open trials, we ask subjects to design lighting configurations based on suggested appearance, evaluating how each paradigm supports artistic exploration. Third, we ask users to fill in a series of questionnaires, collecting usability ratings, preferences, and comments regarding each interface. Subjects work with relatively simple scenes, of different geometric complexity, that are lit by up to eight lights, spending at least one hour with each interface. As an example of our setup, Fig. 1 shows screenshots of a subject lighting with each interface. We perform a thorough analysis of objective and subjective data collected during our study and draw the following conclusions:\n      ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n      26:2 ? W.

We also hope that our findings will be applicable  to other appearance design problems, such as material design. Furthermore, we believe that the principles used to design our study can be employed to evaluate additional lighting tasks in moving toward a comprehensive evaluation of lighting design interfaces.\n      \n        2 Lighting Interface Paradigms\n        Here we review the main user interface paradigms used in the development of lighting design interfaces. Direct Interfaces. Interfaces based on a direct manipulation paradigm, widely used in commercial software such as Maya [Autodesk Inc 2009] and Xsi [Autodesk Inc 2008], require users to select lights and directly modify individual properties. For example, a light can be moved and reoriented in the scene by clicking and dragging widgets [Conner et al. 1992], and have properties such as intensity modified with a slider. Indirect Interfaces. Interfaces based on an indirect manipulation paradigm allow users to directly interact with lighting features as they appear on object surfaces. Illumination hot spots, shadows, and specular and diffuse highlights can be adjusted by dragging and scaling them across surfaces, without the need to explicitly edit light parameters. Poulin and Fournier [1992] allow users to manipulate the shadow volume to place shadows, while specular highlights are specified by clicking points on surfaces. More recently, Pellacini et al. [2002], inspired by [Gleicher and Witkin 1992], showed how users can directly move and scale shadows and hotspots on object surfaces using a simple click-and-drag interface. Painting Interfaces. Interfaces based on a painting paradigm further abstract the idea of lighting by requiring users to paint a desired goal image that is then matched by optimizing light parameters to minimize the difference between the painted image and the rendered one. Subjects paint directly onto the scene to ensure closeness between the painted image and the image generated by the renderer. Schoeneman et al. [1993] use painted input as a goal for setting intensities of lights of known position in a global illumination renderer. Anrys and Dutr? [2004] and Mohan et al. [2005] use a similar approach to relight real objects whose appearance is captured using image-based lighting techniques. Poulin et al. [1997] use sketches of shadows and highlights to place point lights for ellipsoid geometry. Recently, Pellacini et al. [2007] presented a general painting interface for direct illumination of arbitrary scenes where all light parameters are derived using an efficient non-linear optimization framework. Okabe et al. [2007] used a painting interface to edit image-based environmental illumination. Several researchers have investigated methods for optimizing lighting-related parameters in order to achieve a variety of other goals, as surveyed in [Patow and Pueyo 2003]. In the context of lighting design, Kawai et al. [1993] maximize the subjective impression of scene qualities (e.g., pleasantness or privateness), while Shacked and Lischinski [2001], Gumhold [2002], Lee et al. [2004] and Shesh and Chen [2007] maximize low-level perceptual qualities for visualization. Costa et al. [1999] explore the use of even more complex constraints. Rather than asking users to directly specify a lighting goal, Marks et al. [1997] supports parameter exploration by generating many possible goals and letting the user choose the best options.\n      \n      \n        3 Study Overview\n        Goal. We seek to evaluate the relative efficiency of different interface paradigms in the context of simple lighting setups with a\n        ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n        Toward Evaluating Lighting Design Interface Paradigms for Novice Users ? 26:3\n        focus on novice users. Specifically, (1) we want to measure how efficiently these users can perform specific lighting adjustments and (2) we want to understand which interface paradigms provide a more intuitive exploration of the lighting design space. Users. We choose to focus on novices with little or no prior knowledge of lighting design since they make up the majority of users who can take advantage of intuitive interfaces. We ask 20 subjects to light for about 4-5 hours each to ensure good statistical significance of our tests, while reducing fatigue. We considered extending our study to experts, but were concerned that long-term professional training with a very specific interface would likely bias their opinions and measured performance. Interfaces. We compare four user interfaces, each following a major paradigm: direct, indirect and two variations of painting. Direct and indirect interfaces are similar in that they fundamentally support a one-light-at-a-time workflow, where users explicitly select and adjust individual lights. This workflow scales linearly with lighting complexity, becoming cumbersome for complex setups. They differ in the effectiveness with which they support adjustments, where indirect interfaces are believed to be superior since they allow explicit manipulation of lighting features. Painting interfaces are believed to be effective for two reasons. First, since painted goals can refer to all lights at once, theoretically they avoid the need to understand complex lighting setups, e.g. contribution of individual lights or quantity and types of lights. This would make paint scale better with lighting complexity. Second, it is believed that users can more directly express lighting goals using a natural painting metaphor that requires no understanding of the behavior of lights. To validate the relative effectiveness of these two benefits, we consider two variations of painting: painting with all lights, and painting with a single light at a time only. While the former should have all the claimed benefits of painting, the latter is more similar to the workflow of direct and indirect interfaces, differing from them in the use of painted images to control light adjustments. For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these four interfaces as direct, indirect, paint-all, paint-one. Tasks. We ask users to perform two types of lighting tasks to measure interface effectiveness in performing specific adjustments and in aiding artistic exploration. During matching trials, users are asked to match a given scene and set of lights to an image of the same scene under a target lighting configuration. Matching trials allow us to quantitatively measure users? performance, while providing a clear goal for subjects who have never experienced lighting design before. This provides context for the more subjective open trials, where users are given an image from a movie set lit with a specific style and asked to light an unrelated still life scene with the same style. Given the differences in scene geometry, open trials require users to light the scene with a different lighting configuration than the one used for the goal. These trials allow us to observe how users explore the space of possible lighting configurations, a more natural but harder to measure task.\n      \n      \n        4 Experiment\n        Overview. We ask subjects to complete a number of lighting trials where we record all of their actions for further analysis. Each subject performs the trials using all interfaces. These trials vary in the complexity of lighting, type of geometry, and task goal. In addition to recording subjects? actions, we ask them to communicate their experiences on a series of questionnaires to collect subjective evaluation of each interface?s strengths and weaknesses. Reducing Complexity. Since lighting design is a long and tedious process, a study that involves lighting tasks requires a careful triage between completeness and length. On the one hand, we want to  achieve complex-enough lighting to ensure meaningful measurements. On the other, we want to ensure that novice subjects can successfully complete the required tasks without incurring too much fatigue, to avoid bias in data collection. We simplify lighting and scene complexity to ensure that lighting effects and their relationship with scene geometry are clear. With regard to interfaces, we simplify implementation to ensure that they are simple enough to be quickly learned while sufficiently complete to capture the main characteristics of each paradigm. Preparatory Studies. To determine exactly how to perform this needed simplification, we conducted formal and informal preparatory user studies on roughly 20 additional subjects, the results of which are not included in this paper. We compared different versions of scene geometry and lighting, choosing the most complex configuration that ensured at least one out of two subjects could complete the lighting. We also compared several variations in the implementation of the mentioned interface paradigms, choosing the one that showed the best performance in these preparatory studies. In the remainder of this section we will discuss our choices, only referring explicitly to these preparatory studies when we differ substantially from published work. Lights. We limit the possible configurations of single lights by presenting subjects with two different types of lights typical of computer cinematography [Calahan 1999]: key lights and fill lights, shown in Fig. 2 . In our implementation, key lights are represented as spotlights and cast shadows. They have seven degrees of freedom: position, orientation, intensity, and cone angle. Fill lights are represented as omni-directional point light sources that do not cast shadows or create specular highlights, following common practices in computer cinematography. They have four degrees of freedom: position and intensity. All lights have distance squared falloff. We chose to light our scenes with a maximum of eight lights, including two key and six fill lights. While this number might seem small, we found that most novices cannot complete lighting tasks for significantly larger configurations in reasonable time for an experiment without incurring substantial fatigue. Furthermore, while it is known that production lighting uses hundreds of lights, the reader should be aware that such lights are selectively turned on only on a small number of objects [Calahan 1999], a practice also supported by commercial packages (e.g. known as ?light linking? in Maya). This process essentially reduces production lighting to a large set of small and independent lighting tasks, each closer to our complexity. Scenes. We include two versions of scene geometry in our experiments, shown in Fig. 3 : a room-like environment containing two characters and the same scene strongly simplified to obtain an abstract environment where the characters are simple oval shapes. Subjects were given only one or the other geometry type to work with, allowing us to compare the effect of geometric complexity of lighting design. We also considered an abstract blob scene and a realistic tabletop scene, following [Vangorp et al. 2007] guidelines for geometry, and found that possible lighting configurations\n        key light fill light\n        \n          \n          Figure 2: Light types used in our study.\n        \n        ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n        26:4 ?

As in traditional introductory photography education on lighting, we limit all scene elements to grayscale, simulating black-andwhite photography. This aids subjects? understanding and recognition of lighting features, as they do not have to factor in hue blending, allowing us to focus our measurements precisely on the tasks of determining shape and intensity of lights.  Trials. We perform three matching trials of progressively more complex lighting, going from two to eight lights, and two open trials with different goal styles. Details of each trial are summarized in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 . We vary matching trials in lighting complexity to observe possible changes in workflow and trends in the effectiveness of each interface under these conditions. Specifically we include relatively simple 2 and 4 light cases, where subjects are expected to quickly converge on a good solution, as well as a more complex 8 light case. For open trials, we select target images that obviously differ from the given scene in content to force freeform artistic exploration. We choose one high-key and one low-key lighting goal to force two different interpretations of the scene. Subjects are given access to 8 lights for open trials. The same initial and goal lighting configurations are used for all subjects and all interfaces. We limit interaction time to 5 minutes for 2 and 4 lights, and 10 minutes for 8 lights to adjust for the increase in complexity. Subjects can opt to end the trial sooner if satisfied with the current result. At the end of each matching trial, subjects rate the accuracy of the matching with a scale 1 to 5. For open trials, subjects use the same scale to rate how closely they have achieved their interpretation of the style. Questionnaire. After performing all trials with all interfaces, subjects complete a questionnaire where they rate the interface on a scale of 1 to 5 in the following areas: (1) natural way to think about lighting; (2) ease of determining what to modify (selection), (3) how it should be modified (intention), and (4) in carrying out the adjustment; (5) preference on few lights, and (6) many lights; (7) preference in matching trials, and (8) open trials; and (9) overall preference. Subjects also strictly rank interfaces in each of the categories listed above. Immediately after finishing trials for each single interface, subjects are asked to leave free-form comments on each of these aspects. For reproducibility, we include copies of all questionnaires as additional material. Methodology. 20 subjects participated in the study, chosen from different age and educational groups. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Of these 20, 12 subjects had no prior knowledge of 3d graphics, ranking their experience 1 on a scale 1 to 5. The lighting experience of the remaining subjects came from taking up to three classes in Maya, with no specific focus on lighting. All subjects possessed no significant real-world studio lighting experience, rating themselves 2 or lower on a scale of 1 to 5. Subjects complete the study in four 60-minutes sessions, one for each interface. We randomize the order of the interfaces for each subject. Before each session, subjects complete a training phase to familiarize themselves with the specific interface, where an investigator explains the types of lights and how the interface is used to manipulate them. To ensure understanding, subjects are asked to use each interface command on the training scene shown in Fig. 2 . Once trials begin, all user interface actions are recorded. Trials were conducted in a controlled lighting environment with negligible ambient lighting, to simulate typical working conditions of lighting artists. We used a 24-inch Dell 2407WFPb LCD at 1920x1200 resolution at a distance of approximately 1 foot from the subject. All rendered images are 512x512 pixels on screen. We used an Intel 2.8 Ghz Core2 Quad Q9550 PC with 4 GB of RAM and an NVidia GeForce 9800 GT graphics card. Input devices were a standard keyboard and 3-button mouse. All interactions were ensured to be realtime.\n        target\n        \n          \n        \n        trial 4 trial 5\n        \n          Figure 4: Target configuration for open trials.

The supplemental video demonstrates each interface in detail to ensure that our experiments are reproducible.  Common Features. All interfaces use the same screen layout ( Fig. 5 ), showing a workspace window, a help-and-selection box, and two windows showing the goal image and the current lighting. Only the workspace camera can be moved freely. Keyboard shortcuts are used to select different tools. We support one-level undo and a common light selection, by clicking on light names, in addition to light selection methods specific to each interface. In indirect and painting interfaces, edits can be restricted to a single geometric object. Direct. The direct light editing interface is implemented in a manner similar to Xsi [Autodesk Inc 2008] and supports light translation and rotation, scaling of hotspot width and intensity selection using a grayscale palette. All manipulations are performed in world coordinates since we found other choices to be confusing for novices. Selection is performed by clicking on individual lights. Indirect. The indirect lighting interface is implemented in a manner similar to [Pellacini et al. 2002] and supports the translation and scaling of shadows, spotlight hotspots, and diffuse and specular highlights; light intensity is implemented as in the direct interface. Selection is performed by clicking on lighting features, e.g. shadows and highlights. Painting. Our painting interface uses the non-linear optimization method of [Pellacini et al. 2007], but with a simplified set of painting tools. In particular, we provide a brush tool, to lighten, darken or set the chosen intensity similarly to Photoshop [Adobe Systems Inc 2009], and a gradient tool, where intensity is interpolated according to the surface normals similarly to [Pellacini et al. 2007]. We facilitate refinement by allowing copies of the current configuration to the paint layer. When working with one light, selection is performed by clicking on light names. We differ considerably from published work in that we run the optimizer continuously while the user is painting rather than alternating painting and optimization steps. This gives users interactive feedback while editing and turned out to be significantly superior to a paint-then-optimize workflow in our pre-studies. In particular, we noticed that subjects use this feedback to ?steer? the optimization toward their desired goal similarly to user-guided optimization methods, e.g. [Marks et al. 2000], and in doing so are significantly more efficient than with the alternating approach.\n        ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n        Toward Evaluating Lighting Design Interface Paradigms for Novice Users ? 26:5\n        \n          \n          Figure 5: Study interface layout.\n        \n      \n      \n        6 Analysis\n        We present our results in 2 parts. First, we analyze the output of the rendering system as subjects proceed through each trial. Second, we compile the input provided by users in the questionnaires. Unless stated otherwise, tests for statistical significance are computed with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) [Stevens 1996]. Repeated measures ANOVA is appropriate when a withinsubject factor (in our case, each subject using all interfaces) creates\n        0.25 0.125\n      \n      \n        ? direct ? indirect ? paint-all ? paint-one\n        0 0 300\n        \n          Figure 6: Example graph of L 1 error over time for trial 1, corresponding to the screenshots in Fig. 1\n        \n        0.2 direct indirect paint-all paint-one 0.0 Trial 1 Trial 2 Trial 3 Average\n        \n          Figure 7: Average of the final L 1 error for matching trials.\n        \n        correlations that violate the independence assumption of a traditional 1-way ANOVA. A p value below 0.1 indicates a 90% confidence that the two population means differ given the measure of the sample. In all figures, error bars represent standard error. Time to Completion. Generally, subjects are able to complete each trial within the allotted time limit with one or more interfaces. On average, time to completion is similar across all interfaces and lies relatively close to the time limit (290 s for trials 1 and 2, 520 s for trial 3 and 410 s for trials 4 and 5). Image Error. To evaluate user performance in matching trials, we compute the L 1 error between the subject?s rendered image and the goal image. We chose L 1 since we found it to be more robust than other metrics, including L 2 , measures of relative error, and metrics over lighting parameters. We chose not to use perceptual metrics since most are variations of visual difference predictors, only valid near just noticeable difference, while our image errors are much larger. Fig. 6 shows the L 1 error over time for one subject performing the same trial with all interfaces. When subjects are successful, error decreases toward the correct solution, showing convergence to the goal. This convergence is not monotonic, but interrupted by moments where users explore local configurations, often with a new tool. For reference, we include the error graph for all subjects in supplemental material together with screenshots of the lighting configuration over time. Fig. 7 shows the L 1 error between the final image and the target image averaged across all subjects. Direct and indirect outperform painting in final error in all trials (p < 0.094), with slightly less significance on indirect compared to paint-all on trial 3. On trial 1, there is a slight advantage of indirect over direct and paint-one over paint-all (p > 0.141). On trials 2 and 3, direct and indirect produce similar error, as do paint-all and paint-one (p > 0.592). Convergence. To illustrate the convergence behavior of different interfaces, we average the image error across all subjects over time in Fig. 8 . While we acknowledge that this average is not statistically valid, since edits are not synchronized across subjects, we find that this gives an intuitive visual indication of overall behavior. The starting error begins much higher on trial 3, since we designed this trial to be more challenging than others. Notice the clear difference of the two paint interfaces vs. direct and indirect. For trials 1 and 2, direct and indirect roughly converge on a solution while paint-all and paint-one do not. On trial 3, the painting interfaces are able to\n        ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n        26:6 ? W.

This suggests that while users are able to light, different interfaces support different convergence behaviors. Overall, we conclude that painting interfaces are the worst performing in terms of final error and convergence, while direct and indirect are relatively close in performance. Subjective Image Quality. Subjects rate the closeness of their final output to the intended target on a scale of 1 to 5. Fig. 9 shows the average ratings for each trial. We find that this subjective image quality roughly correlates with the L 1 error of the final image with a linear correlation coefficient of ?0.55. In all matching trials, indirect and direct interfaces surpass paint-one and paint-all (p < 0.114). People perform slightly better with indirect than direct on trial 1 (p = 0.118), but otherwise there is no significant difference between direct and indirect or between paint-all and paintone on matching trials (p > 0.359). In open trials, subjective image quality for the painting interfaces relative to the direct and indirect interfaces on open trials are substantially higher. In fact, there is no major difference between direct, indirect, and paint-all ratings on trial 4 (p > 0.167). This suggests that while people perceive their performance with painting interfaces to be worse than the others in adjustments tasks (matching trials), in exploration tasks (open trials) subjects perceive their performance with painting to be greatly improved. Rankings and Ratings. Subjects rate and rank each interface in 9 categories where ratings can have ties, but rankings are forced choice (see Sec. 4). Average ratings and stacked frequencies of rankings are shown in Fig. 10 . For evaluating statistical significance of ranks we use the Friedman test [Friedman 1937], a nonparametric test that takes into account within-subject effects to derive the confidence of consistent distinction indicated by a low p-value. In all categories except preference on open trials, the non-painting interfaces rank significantly higher than painting (p < 0.025). As with the subjective image ratings, direct and indirect still rank higher than the painting interfaces on open trial preference, but by significantly less. The majority of subjects rank indirect higher than direct in most categories. By analyzing the ratings across subjects using two-step cluster analysis that first sequentially clusters and then performs hierarchical clustering, we found that there are two separate groups\n      \n      \n        Trial 3\n      \n      \n        ? direct ? indirect ? paint-all ? paint-one\n        600\n        that consistently prefer direct better than indirect and vice versa. This suggests that subjects distinguish between the two. Between these groups, more people prefer indirect over direct. With almost no exception, the differences between paint-one and paint-all are negligible (p > 0.371). We find similar trends in the ratings. On all categories except open trial preference, direct and indirect rate much higher than paint-one and paint-all (p < 0.005). With almost no exception, there is no significant distinction between direct and indirect or between paintall and paint-one in the ratings (p > 0.249). To further understand which factors are perceived as important in judging interfaces, we correlate the overall preference ratings to ratings in all other categories using linear correlation. Across all interfaces, the ratings of adjustment and matching trial preference correlate most closely with overall preference (corr. coeff. 0.89 and 0.84 respectively). This implies that our subjects prefer interfaces that give them the control required to precisely control and adjust lighting features. Subject Prior Experience. In Fig. 11 we compare subjects with previous lighting experience to those without by showing the average over matching trials of the L 1 error and subjective image quality ratings. For direct (p < 0.005) and indirect (p < 0.2) interfaces, subjects with prior experience perform better overall. This is to be expected given that they have some, albeit small, prior training using graphics software. It is interesting to note that their improvement is noticeable whether they use direct or indirect, even if their experience using commercial software only exposed them to direct interfaces. Performance with the painting interfaces is consistent across both groups (p > 0.507, paint-one subjective p = 0.207). Direct vs Indirect. While we found that novices can light with direct and indirect interfaces, a closer comparison of the two is warranted. In most cases, these interfaces perform closely, with indirect affording slightly quicker convergence. When subjects are forced to choose they rank indirect higher in most categories, including overall preference where 13 out of 20 prefer indirect. We also observe that if we partition the subjects into those who did and did not rank indirect higher than direct in overall preference, these groups do not correlate with those with prior direct interface experience and those without (corr. coeff. 0.043). This implies that prior training in the use of direct does not imply its preference. This is quite unexpected since subjects should perform significantly better with a more familiar interface. Taking into account all these facts, we conclude that while there are some who like using direct more than indirect, indirect is an overall more efficient and preferable interface. Scene Complexity. We have shown that varying interfaces clearly influence lighting performance. Unexpectedly, we found that scene complexity influences user performance to a significantly lesser degree. In particular, we found no significant differences, across all measurements, between subjects who worked on scenes with char- acter geometry and those who worked on scenes with abstract geometry. Furthermore, while the matching trials become increasingly more complex with the number of lights, we found that given enough time to complete, the lighting complexity of the scene does not hinder performance significantly. As discussed above, subjective estimations do not suggest that working with more lights is significantly worse, and while final image error is slightly higher with 8 lights, the initial configuration of the trial also has higher error.\n        ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n        Toward Evaluating Lighting Design Interface Paradigms for Novice Users ? 26:7\n        #!\" !\" D I A O D I A O D I A O D I A O D I A O D I A O D I A O D I A O D I A O Natural Selection Intention Adjustment Few Many Matching Open Overall 5 1 Natural Selection Intention Adjustment Few\n        \n          Figure 10: Interface rankings and ratings from questionnaire.\n        \n        0.2 5 direct indirect paint-all paint-one 0.0 1 !\"#$%&'(% )\"%&'(% !\"#$%&'(% )\"%&'(%\n        \n          Figure 11: Comparison of subjects with prior lighting experience to those without in terms of final L 1 error (left) and subject image quality ratings (right).

We will use the example of one subject illustrated in Fig. 1 with corresponding error in Fig. 6 . In supplemental material, we include similar diagrams for all subjects. We also show recorded lighting trials for a few subjects in the paper video. Sketching Paint. The most noticeable trend regarding the painting interfaces is that people consistently draw rough sketches to represent areas where light should or should not appear, but pay little attention to how light would actually affect the scene in terms of gradients. The applied paint is usually very bright or very dark, and does not respect objects boundaries (even though tools were provided to simplify this). Furthermore, when subjects attempt to paint local lighting features, such as shadows or highlights, they do not compensate for the overall effect of the light, essentially attempting to treat some features as independent from the others. We found this behavior in all subjects. Finally, 55% of subjects openly commented that they just can?t figure out what paint adjustments to make to get the lights to go where intended. These observations are confirmed by visualizing the error of the painted image and the image generated by the optimized light-\n        rank 4 D direct rank 3 I indirect rank 2 A paint-all rank 1 O paint-one direct? indirect? paint?all? paint?one?

In these graphs, there is a clear trend of paint error exceeding the error of the lighting configuration. This behavior clearly indicates that subjects are attempting to steer the optimization of lights with rough sketches, rather than attempting to reproduce the target image by painting. Sketching One vs All Lights. While we observed this sketching behavior in each of the painting interfaces, there are fundamental differences between the two. We found that sketching can only effectively control one light at a time since subjects tend to sketch individual lighting features. However, 40% of subjects make comments about the difficulty of controlling one light at a time, e.g. ?because I was painting for individual lights it was sometimes hard to account for the effects of the other lights?. Essentially when lighting complexity increases, painting single lights becomes less intuitive and more difficult. At the same time, while painting all lights addressed this confusion, it remains unintuitive since subjects expect to be able to paint individual lighting features while the optimizer guesses which light to apply it to. We believe that this mismatch between sketching versus painting is the key to interpreting the low performance of painting interfaces in matching trials. One-Light-At-A-Time Workflow. Direct, indirect and paint-one share the same fundamental workflow, where users work one light at a time. When using the direct and indirect interfaces, 95% of subjects work by first blocking the key lights, that show the most prominent lighting features, then adjusting fill lights, to eventually go back and refine iteratively. When using paint-one, subjects exhibit the same order of adjustments, but only 35% are actually able to refine due to time limits. While our matching trials progressively increase in lighting complexity with 2, 4, and 8 lights, we found this iterative workflow is common to all three trials. Furthermore, 45% of subjects exhibited the behavior of turning off all lights then adding them back one at a time, adjusting iteratively. We believe that the consistency of this behavior is remarkable, since many of our subjects had no knowledge of lighting and yet they converged to the same workflow. We believe this implies that alternating blocking and refinement, used in computer cinematography [Calahan 1999], is a fundamental aspect of lighting design. One-Light-At-A-Time Adjustments. Sharing the same workflow, the difference between the three interfaces discussed is in how quickly adjustments can be performed. Looking at questionnaire comments helps in interpreting this difference. 30% of subjects comment that direct requires more trial and error than indirect, while 35% comment that moving light sources along 3d axes can be confusing. 35% of subjects commented that they had trouble moving fill lights with indirect, since they exhibit no sharp and clearly distinguishable feature, the control of which was not the design goals of indirect methods. This explains why the benefit of the indirect interface versus direct decreases on more complex trials that have a higher ratio of fill versus key lights. We conclude that the indirect interface allows subjects to work faster in general, but the performance increase is less noticeable when controlling soft gradients, as expected with an interface designed to control ?hard? lighting features. Exploration. In open trials the performance of painting metaphors increases. This is unexpected since we verified that these methods provide poor control for lighting. We believe this is due to the fact that subjects are performing a purely exploratory task that requires no precise adjustment. 70% of subjects commented directly that they are conducting an exploration task, more akin to just blocking, rather then refining. E.g., ?the open-ended trials I tended to experiment more with, as if I expected to serendipitously encounter a nice lighting configuration,? and ?I could aim for what I know I could do and still have it be in the approximate style?. This does not mean that subjects are randomly moving lights around, but rather that they are using exploration to converge on something they find to be acceptable. If one takes into account how poorly people can control lighting with painting, we conclude that painting metaphors are better at pure exploration, but they lack the needed control for a full solution to lighting design.\n        ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n        26:8 ? W. Kerr et al.\n      \n      \n        8 Discussion\n        In this section, we summarize the major findings of our study. Before continuing, we want to remind the reader that strictly speaking our observations only apply within the boundary of the tested cases. Novices Can Light. We have found that, in the modest complexity cases shown, novices can light. While this may seem obvious, we believe it is in fact remarkable that subjects with little training can in fact perform these lighting tasks reasonably quickly, provided the interface supports them. This suggests that future work on lighting design for novices will have an impact for a large number of users. Direct and Indirect. We found that while subjects can light well whether they use a direct or indirect interface, indirect manipulation performs overall better in our tests affording a more effective control of lighting adjustments. This suggests that future work on appearance design should consider indirect manipulation as its main control mechanism. Paint vs Non-paint. Our most prominent result is the poor performance of the painting interfaces with respect to the non-painting ones. This is consistently observed in all our data, including image error, convergence, subjective evaluations. Note that this result may not generalize to other appearance design applications, or users with extensive painting training.  Paint Sketching. The underlying assumption of a painting metaphor is that people are better at expressing a goal through paint than they are in configuring light parameters. This study shows that novices tend to be quite poor at painting accurate representations of lighting with the quality necessary to drive an optimizer. Users with more extensive painting training may fare better. However, our subjects tend to sketch rough illumination areas and expect the computer to interpret their input correctly. Our study suggests that interfaces designed specifically to support rough sketching might in fact perform better, as was found in material design [Pellacini and Lawrence 2007; An and Pellacini 2008]. However, in the case of lighting design, it remains unclear how sketching can directly control the features of multiple lights. Paint Selection. Besides control, painting is expected to be effective since it removes the need to understand how many individual lights contribute to the final image, especially troublesome for complex setups. However, the similarity between paint-all and paintone suggests that the inability to control lighting details overshadows the perceived benefit from painting with all lights. Exploration. The superiority of non-painting to painting interfaces is far less obvious for open trials. Taking into account the control problems of painting interfaces, this implies that painting is a better metaphor for tasks where it is desired to quickly block out rough scene lighting. This seems counterintuitive, since people should be better at painting when there is a clear reference. However, we found that painting interfaces afford to users who sketch rough illumination, the presentation of lighting configurations that might not have been encountered using a direct or indirect interface. Factors Influencing Lighting. Besides prior training, differences in interfaces are the only significant factor we found in lighting design performance. Within the boundary of our study, we notice no influence from geometric complexity. We found that lighting is mostly linear in the number of lights, suggesting that given enough time, people are not hindered by the increase in complexity. While we absolutely do not believe that our findings on scene complexity extend to the significantly more complex scenes used in feature film production, it is our opinion that for the simple scenes that novices are likely to manipulate complexity does not matter. Limitations. First, as in all user studies, the main limitation of our work is the space of lighting tasks we have explored. Second, we did not include expert subjects, in lighting or painting, since they belong to a completely different user group. Third, we have only explored a fraction, albeit large, of all possible lighting models, of which natural illumination and color certainly deserve further consideration. We believe that these three extensions are the most important explorations to focus on in future work to eventually reach a comprehensive study of lighting design paradigms. Implications. While this study is just the first step toward a comprehensive evaluation of lighting design interfaces, it already provides clear information on general trends that will influence future lighting interface development. Furthermore, we believe that these same trends are general enough to be applied to other appearance design domains, such as material design. Finally, we expect that the principles employed in designing our studies can be adopted to evaluate other appearance design tasks, such as natural illumination and material design.\n      \n      \n        9 Conclusions\n        This paper presented a first step toward the evaluation of lighting design interface paradigms for novice users. By performing a series of matching and open trials in simple scenes with up to 8 point lights and by collecting subject evaluation in questionnaires, we  have measured how different interfaces aid subjects in performing specific lighting adjustments and in the artistic exploration of lighting configurations. We conclude that novices can light well with direct and indirect interfaces, with the latter being preferred. Painting interfaces perform significantly worse, due to the tendency of users to sketch, rather than paint, goal images. Furthermore, within the realm of our studies, we found that geometric and lighting complexity do not hinder the ability of subjects to light. While, as in any user study, we acknowledge that our measurements are only strictly valid with the tested scenes, we do believe that the main trends found in our study may generalize to other lighting tasks. In addition, we expect that our experiment design will be used as the base for further explorations of the effectiveness of appearance editing interfaces. In the future, we are interested in extending our study to include expert lighters and natural illumination, moving toward a comprehensive evaluation of lighting interface paradigms. Furthermore, we are also interested in investigating a hybrid interface that will include the measured benefits of all the paradigms tested.\n        ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 28, No. 3, Article 26, Publication date: August 2009.\n        Toward Evaluating Lighting Design Interface Paradigms for Novice Users ? 26:9\n      \n      \n        Acknowledgements\n        We would like to thank Xiaobo An, Lori Lorigo, and George Wolford for their help in preparing this paper.
