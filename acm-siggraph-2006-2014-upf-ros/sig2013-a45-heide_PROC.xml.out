  "content" : "In this paper, we explore the use of photonic mixer devices (PMD), commonly used in inexpensive time-of-flight cameras, as alternative instrumentation for transient imaging. PMD sensors are commonly used in time-of-flight cameras, and can be obtained for a few hundred dollars. This camera is used in conjunction with inexpensive laser diodes as an illuminant. We demonstrate how models for local light interaction similar to the ones used by Wu et al. [2012] can be used to extract transient images from such a setup, thus enabling research on the applications of transient imaging on a much smaller budget. ? We formulate the estimation of transient images from PMD measurements as an inverse problem that is ill-conditioned but can be solved by introducing regularization terms as well as a model of local surface/light interactions, and by splitting the resulting hard problem into a sequence of simpler optimization problems (Section 3). ? We demonstrate a prototype system with a modified PMD camera that allows for flexible measurements of time-of-flight images using a range of different modulation frequencies and phases (Section 4). The system is inexpensive, portable, eyesafe, insensitive to background light, and acquires data at a much higher rate than streak cameras, enabling transient imaging even outside lab environments. This effectively allows PMDs to modulate the incident illumination with another signal during light integration, which, in combination with a modulated light source, can be used for time-of-flight depth imaging. In our work we apply some of the same hardware strategies developed in these papers ? increasing the number of modulation frequencies and phases ? to acquire a large set of correlated modulation measurements. Using these measurements we derive a novel optimization strategy that allows us to infer the full transient image under global illumination and complex lighting by solving an optimization problem. In the following we present a slightly simplified model for the imaging process of photonic mixer devices, and show how measurements obtained with PMD sensors relate to time-of-flight imaging and transient images. PMD Sensor. Specifically, a PMD sensor measures the modulated exposure where ? is a programmable phase offset. Illumination. For time-of-flight (TOF) applications, PMDs are used in conjunction with illumination that is also modulated in intensity. Although some researchers have suggested working in a heterodyne setup [Dorrington et al. 2007; Conroy et al. 2009], where the light modulation frequency differs from the modulation frequency of the PMD, most current PMD applications assume a homodyne setup, where both frequencies are the same. PMD Time-of-Flight Imaging. With the light and sensor modulations described above, the modulated exposure measured by the PMD sensor becomes NT H ?,? = (E 0 + ?E m g ? (t + ? )) f ? (t + ?) dt 0 T =E 0 ? N f ? (t + ?) dt 0 =0 T + ?E m ? N g ? (t + ? )f ? (t + ?) dt . Using the known c ?,? (? ), it is then possible to solve for the pixel intensity ?E m and the distance d of the object visible at that pixel. Multiple Modulation Frequencies and Phases. This yields a collection of different, travel-time dependent correlation coefficients c ? i ,? i (? ). While Dorrington et al. [2011] have recently also proposed to use more than one modulation frequency to improve depth estimates in the presence of indirect illumination, for our transient imaging system, we significantly increase the number to hundreds of different frequencies. Global Illumination. For the modulated exposure, this yields where ?(? ) physically represents the integral of all contributions from different light paths p that correspond to the same travel time ? : Here, ? p is the light attenuation along a given ray path p connecting the light source and the sensor pixel, P is the space of all such ray paths, and |p| is the travel time along path p.  Relationship to Transient Imaging. The sequence of ?(? ) for different values of ? is a transient pixel, which is the impulse response of a sensor element, i.e. the intensity profile of a pixel as a function of time when the scene is illuminated by a very short pulse of light. A regular grid of such transient pixels ? x,y (? ) is known as a transient image I(x, y, ? ) = ? x,y (? ). A model for the formation of transient images was proposed by [Smith et al. 2008]. The corresponding vectorized image (with the components stacked) is i, and h denotes the vector of all modulated exposures observed at all pixels in the image. The correlation coefficients c ? i ,? i can be arranged in a matrix C that maps a transient image to the vector of observations h. Ignoring any measurement noise, this yields the following linear inverse problem for the recovery of i, which is a discrete version of Equation 4: This problem, however, is poorly conditioned, since the correlation coefficients vary slowly with distance for the range of feasible modulation frequencies and scene scales (Section 4). This makes it impossible to directly solve for i. To solve this challenging inverse problem, we introduce both spatial and temporal regularization terms, impose a non-linear model m(u) ? i for the local interaction of light with objects, and optimize for both the transient image i and the model parameters u in a least-squares sense: We expect the gradients for both the spatial and temporal slices to be sparse, but with occasional outliers (discontinuities). This motivates the use of robust norms in both regularizations terms. In our work we chose the Huber penalty function 1 . H since it suppresses outliers, but gives a smooth reconstruction for small gradient magnitudes. Finally, the last line from Equation 7 contains two terms that fit the data with a model m(?), and tie the estimated model parameters u back to the reconstructed intrinsic image i. Thus, in Equation 7, we use three additional priors to regularize our strongly ill-conditioned problem from Equation 6. That is a) by using a model m(?), b) a temporal smoothness regularizer and c) a spatial smoothness regularization. Our model is inspired by recent work by Wu et al. [2012] and applies to each pixel independently. Specifically, we model the light interaction at each local surface point as a combination of surface reflection and subsurface scattering. In a complex scene with global illumination, the model m x (?) for the time profile at pixel x can therefore be expressed as a superposition of a number of Gaussians and exponentials where the model parameters u are the set of all (temporal) positions p x,i for the Gaussians and exponentials, combined with their amplitudes g x,i and a x,i , and finally the exponential decay parameters d x,i which depend on the density of the scattering medium. With the model defined, we can now in principle minimize Equation 7 by alternating between two steps, one where we solve for i, given fixed values of u from the previous iteration and vice-versa. In the very first i-step, all terms containing the model m(?) are ignored. However, the u-subproblem is still non-convex, and so we add additional constraints to restrict the space of possible solutions for this subproblem to a region where we expect at least locally a\n          1 The Huber penalty function [Huber 1973] is an 1 / 2 hybrid error measure and defined as |x| ? /2 ; |x| > x H = h (x i ) with h (x) = x 2 /(2 ) ; else i\n          convex function: (u opt , i opt ) = argmin u,i 2 1 Ci ? h 2 2 + ? ? i x H + ? x i ? H + x ? 1 2 Cm(u) ? h 2 2 + ? 2 i ? m(u) 2 2 + (9) ? 2 maxima(i x ) ? p x 2 2 x s.t. ?x, i : K x = #maxima(i x ) ? g x,i , a x,i , d x,i ? [0, 1]\n          Here maxima(i x ) are the positions of all local time maxima for a pixel x, and #maxima(i x ) is number of such local maxima. The two additional constraints therefore express that we prefer locations of Gaussians and exponentials close to the onset positions, that we restrict the number K x to be the number of onsets, and constrain the numerical range of Gaussian and exponential amplitudes and decays. We now discuss in detail how to solve the two subproblems. We initialize our method with i = 0, u = 0. By fixing u in Equation 9 and neglecting the terms constraining the location of maxima, we obtain the following optimization problem for i: i opt = argmin i 1 2 Ci ? h 2 2 + In this subproblem, neglecting the maxima terms is justified by the fact that these terms will be dominated by ? 2 i ? m(u) 2 2 for large ? (recall that we only introduced the extra terms to account for the non-convexity of the u-subproblem). Equation 10 is a regularized linear-inverse problem. We solve it with the first-order primal-dual framework by Chambolle and Pock [2011], which considers general problems of the form where the operators F, K, G are the same as in [Chambolle and Pock 2011]. For example, in an inverse problem with a TV regularizer, the first term in Equation 11 is the regularizer (that is K(i) = i, F(j) = j 1 for TV), while the second term is the data fitting term. Equation 10 can be expressed in this framework by defining K(i) = Si To solve this problem with Chambolle and Pock?s algorithm, we need to derive the proximal operators for F ? and G. These are provided in Appendix A. In the second subproblem, we fix i in Equation 9 and solve u, leading to the following problem: However, by constraining the parameters, and especially the onset p, we limit the search to regions where we expect locally convex behavior. We first determine K x = #maxima(i x ) by explicitly detecting the number of peaks in time for each pixel signal i x . No noise suppression or further smoothing is needed since we require only a good lower bound for K x . Accurate fitting is then handled by solving Equation 13. The resulting problem (with K x now fixed) can be solved independently for each pixel. To account for the non-convexity we perform a two-step optimization per pixel signal: first, several steps of a global search in the constrained parameter space are done using the derivative-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search method for non-linear constrained optimization (MADS) [Audet and Dennis Jr 2006]. This direct search method models the parameter space using a mesh. By adaptively probing the mesh and also adaptively changing the mesh refinement this method makes good progress in regions around local minimizers. We use the implementation in the MATLAB generalized pattern search function ?patternsearch? in the Global Optimization Toolbox, random polling and a maximum number of 1000 iterations. We expect the parameters found by this derivative-free global optimization to lie at least in a locally convex region. To effectively find the according minimum in this region we now use the gradient and do local constrained gradient-descent iterations using the spectral projected gradient method from the minConf package [Schmidt 2013]. The projection operator that encodes our constraints is straightforward to derive since in our case we only have simple box constraints. We use here analytic gradient information of the unconstrained version of Eq. For this subproblem, all the components u x for a pixel x are independent of the components for other pixels. So, for a single component j of u, we obtain the following gradient component: Thus, with Eq. 15, we have reduced the gradient computation for ?(u) to the evaluation of the partial derivatives of a pixel time sequence m ? (u) with respect to its parameters (that is the Gaussian amplitude, exponential amplitude, exponential decay and the position of the Gaussian and exponential). These partial derivatives are straightforward to derive from Equation 8. With optimization split into two stages as described above, the isubproblem is fast and convex, and provides a data term plus spatial and temporal regularization, with the tendency to overly smoothen the results. After the final u-step, we always perform another i-step to obtain a final transient image from the model parameters. Figure 3 compares the time sequences obtained for a single pixel with ground truth data for a synthetic example (more details on the dataset can be found in Section 5). The left image shows the over-smooth reconstruction after solving just the i subproblem. The center and right image show reconstructions after one and two full iterations, respectively (each followed by a final i-step). We can see that the method is converged after only a single iteration. This is consistent with behavior we observe for the time sequences of other pixels and datasets. Figure 4 shows results for a simple scene where a wavefront travels along a diffuse wall, captured using our PMD camera setup (Sec- tion 4). Using the model, pixel time profiles ( Figure 5 ) show a similar sharpening effect as in the synthetic data set. However, as the full-frame reconstructions show, this extra sharpness comes at the cost of some spatial quantization artifacts. We refer to the accompanying video to observe the full dataset. Because of the tradeoff between temporal sharpness and spatial artifacts, it may in some cases be preferable to only run the i subproblem, depending on whether the goal is to obtain the most detailed measurements possible, or simply to produce visually pleasing results. The camera is based on the PMDTechnologies CamBoard nano, an evaluation platform for the PMD PhotonICs 19k-S3 image sensor. We removed the on-board light source and the default 830 nm longpass filter. Since our technique is based on the use of a wide range of modulation frequencies, we intercepted the on-board modulation  signal and replaced it with our own input from an external source, and added a trigger output that signals the start of the integration phase. We confirmed that the sensor can be operated at modulation frequencies up to 180 MHz, but managed to obtain stable results only up to 110 MHz. Our light source is a bank of six 650 nm laser diodes with a total average output power of 2.4 W. Since the beams are not collimated, eye safety is not a concern at reasonable distances from the device. Two groups of three diodes are driven through a iC-Haus 6-channel constant current driver each (type iC-HG), with each diode occupying two driver outputs for DC bias and the high-frequency modulation. Using a fast photodiode (Thorlabs FDS010) and a 500 MHz, 2 GS/s oscilloscope, we confirm that this setup can modulate the output intensity by a full 100% up to a frequency of 180 MHz. As our modulation source signal, we use the DDS9m/02 signal generator from Novatech Instruments, which is based on the Analog Devices AD9958 direct digital synthesizer chip. We use the digital output of the signal generator to modulate both the light source and the camera with a square wave. A microcontroller circuit sets modulation frequencies and phases on the synthesizer board. Reacting to the trigger signal from the camera, it switches the modulation signals for light source and camera in accordance with the currently set integration time (we take an exposure series from 120 to 1920 ?s in steps of one f-stop). The sensor data is read out through the API provided with the camera board. The hardware components add up to a total cost of approximately $1500, which is well within reach for most research labs. We note that the lab signal generator alone accounts for more than half of the total budget. The Analog Devices chip that this signal generator is based on is available for only $35, so that substantial savings are possible for future revisions of our setup. Measurement Routine. In order to complete a full measurement over a frequency range from 10 to 120 MHz in steps of 0.5 MHz, our capture system takes about 90 seconds. Note that we operate the setup at a duty cycle of less than 1%, in order to avoid overheating of the critical components (signal buffer and laser driver ICs, laser diodes, PMD sensor) that are not equipped with heatsinks or active cooling. We therefore estimate that with proper thermal management, another significant speedup will be achieved, reducing the overall acquisition time to only a few seconds. There are several ways our methods deals with the dynamic range issues. The working principle of PMD sensors is itself is very effective in suppressing ambient illumination, the sensor provides highbit depth readouts (14 bits) and, finally, we do take an exposure sequence as described just above. That said, if very bright light paths and very dim light paths mix in the same pixel, the reconstruction quality of the dim paths will suffer. Calibration. We place camera and light source as close to each other as possible, and facing a diffuse white wall, with no other objects nearby that could scatter light into the line of sight. For each frequency, we sample the distance-dependent correlation coefficients by varying the relative phase between the sensor and the light source modulation signals. This allows us to emulate different optical delays without mechanically moving parts. The calibration measurements for frequencies from 10 to 120 MHz in 1 MHz steps and distances from 0 to 20 m in 0.1 m steps take about 6 hours to complete, with a further 30 minutes to extract the matrix from the raw sensor readings. We average the calibration matrices over a 40?40 pixel region in order to reduce acquisition noise. We note, however, that the calibrated matrix C obtained in this fashion is also valid for different geometric configurations of sensor and camera, with only a change in the physical interpretation of the resulting reconstructed transient images. This means that the calibration step is essentially a one-time operation. Figure 7 shows a color visualization of the recovered correlation coefficients, with the vertical axis corresponding to different frequencies, and the horizontal axis corresponding to different path lengths, or travel times. We evaluated our approach using both synthetic data for ground truth comparisons, and measurements using our custom setup. For our synthetic experiments, we used a transient image that Velten et al. obtained using a femtosecond laser and streak camera [Velten et al. 2013]. Since this dataset was captured for a smaller scene than the size of scenes we target with our setup, we simulated a larger scene by scaling the time dimension by a factor of 20. We then used the PMD sensor model from Equation 4 to simulate measurements of H ? i ,? i for different frequencies and phases, also adding Gaussian noise with a sigma of 1%. Figure 9 shows reconstructed frames (bottom row) in comparison with the ground truth (top). The key features are reproduced, although a certain amount of temporal smoothing is noticeable. An examination of time profiles for additional pixels confirms this analysis ( Figure 10 ). In green, we also show a direct least-squares fit of the model to the ground truth curves. These curves demonstrate the expressiveness of the model. Even though the direct fit exhibits shows sharp discontinuities due to the use of exponential segments with a step function onset, the examples show that the key features of the time sequences can be represented using the model. Furthermore, in the actual reconstruction from PMD measurements, the i-step smoothes out the discontinuities. These results demonstrate that our method can qualitatively reconstruct transient images, including complex scenarios with multiple discrete pulses of light arriving at a surface point, as well as broad temporal profiles resulting from indirect illumination via a diffuse surface. A full quantitative analysis of the resolution limit for our method is complicated by the non-linear nature of our optimization problem and is beyond the scope of this paper. Using our own setup, we captured a few settings with characteristic light transport, including the simple scene from Figure 4 already discussed in Section 3. Individual time slices of three additional datasets are shown in Figure 8 . The scenes and single-image visualizations of the recovered transient images are shown in Figures 1 and 11. We also encourage the reader to watch the accompanying video to see the full transient images. The top row of Figure 8 shows a wavefront propagating though a scene with a mirrored disco ball placed in the corner of a room. In the first frame, the wavefront has just reached the front of the ball. In the second frame, the ball is now fully illuminated, and we see the wavefront propagating along the left wall. The third frame shows the first caustics generated by reflections in the mirror. More caustics appear for longer light paths near the top and bottom of the fourth image, and the direct illumination is now approaching the back of the corner from both sides. First indirect illumination in the floor is visible. The second row of the figure shows a scene with several bottles, filled with water and a small amount of milk to create scattering. In the first frame, the wavefront has just reached the front of the leftmost bottles, and is reflecting off their surface. In the second frame, scattering effects are becoming visible in the bottles. Next, the light reaches the far wall, showing caustics of the light transport through the bottles. Indirect illumination of the back wall from light scattered in the bottles appears in the fourth frame. This light continues to illuminate the back ball even after the bottles themselves have darkened (last frame). Finally, the bottom row of Figure 8 shows a scene with several foreground objects and two mirrors. We first see initial reflections coming off the foreground objects. As the light propagates further, the foreground objects are now fully illuminated, and the wavefront reaches the back walls, but the mirrors remain dark. In the third frame reflections of the foreground objects are starting to become visible in both the left and the right mirror. In the fourth frame, the left mirror shows a reflection of an object in the right mirror. This reflection lingers in the last frame, even after the wavefront has passed by the foreground objects. In this paper we presented a method for transient imaging with PMD sensors, a technology that is widely available in commer cial time-of-flight cameras. The hardware was modified to allow for different modulation frequencies and phases for both the sensor and the illumination. Using a simple model for local light/surface interaction, we can robustly reconstruct transient images from measurements made with this hardware. Unlike existing systems for the capture of transient images, ours does not require ultrafast temporal sensing or illumination, but works with correlation measurements obtained over longer integration periods. As a result, we achieve transient images with hardware costing a fraction of the price of the femtosecond laser/streak camera combination described in the literature. Additional benefits of our approach include significantly reduced acquisition times, more portable hardware, and easier modes of operation. Although our prototype uses only red laser diodes as illumination, true color measurements could be obtained easily by adding green and blue lighting to the system and measuring the corresponding channels in a time-sequential fashion. A disadvantage of our system at the moment is the limited spatial and temporal resolution of the sensor used. The technology is also inexpensive enough that multiple sensors could be tiled together for applications that require higher resolution. The time resolution of our approach is limited by the maximum modulation frequency that can be applied to the illumination and the PMD sensor. In our prototype we were able to achieve modulation frequencies of up to 110 MHz, which corresponds to a spatial wavelength of about 2.70 m. The size of the investigated scene should not be significantly below this wavelength, otherwise the correlation matrix becomes too illconditioned to reliably solve the problem. We therefore work with larger-scale scenes than Velten et al. [2013]. In terms of computational post processing, solving the first half of the optimization problem (the i-subproblem) takes only a few minutes at the full sensor resolution, and can thus provide a quick preview of a smoothed reconstruction. The second step (the usubproblem) is much more expensive, and takes several hours per dataset. It would also be interesting to add a spatial component to the model itself to avoid some of the spatial quantization and banding artifacts that can occur in some results. Our approach models the transient image as a sparse signal in a basis that corresponds to certain light-object interactions, currently surface reflection and subsurface scattering. In summary, we have demonstrated the combination of an inexpensive hardware setup and an optimization problem to acquire transient images using PMD sensors. It is our hope that this approach will reduce the barrier of entry for performing research in transient imaging and its applications, including the use of transient images for reconstructing geometry from indirect illumination [Kirmani et al. 2009; Pandharkar et al. 2011; Velten et al. 2012], and analyzing reflectance properties [Naik et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2012]. We thank PMD Technologies for helpful advice on pinout and operation of their sensors. We further thank Andreas Velten and Ramesh Raskar for sharing their ?tomato? dataset, Lukas Chrostowski and Owen Roberts for their valuable input on modulation of lasers, and Mark Greenstreet for lending us the fast oscilloscope. Using i as the primary domain parameters and j as the dual domain parameters, the proximal operators for the optimization problem\n        defined in Equation 12 can be derived as Note that the first proximal operator amounts to a simple pointwise evaluation. The second operator is a linear system that we solve to high accuracy using SVD.",
