  "content" : "We demonstrate our method on a variety of problems and our results reflect intuitive as well as surprising effects. Given that rigid bodies are often made of metal, a notable lack is that magnetic forces have not yet been considered in this context. In the same way, the total forces and torques converge to those of the original object with increasing number of cells. Hence, the accuracy can be effectively controlled by the number of cells, i.e., the sampling density. Unlike previous approaches our method is symmetric since we use dipoles for computing both magnetic force and field. Magnetic Materials For our simulations, we physically describe a variety of different materials with very different magnetic properties and include them in our computation scheme. In doing so, the user can recognize many familiar interactions between magnets but also experience magnetic effects, which do not necessarily follow intuition, see Fig. 2 . To this end, we have to determine the total magnetic field in every time step. Our approach is based on an approximate solution for the magnetic field of an object with a given magnetization, and, on a corresponding approximation for the calculation of the forces and torques. These approximations make use of a subdivision of objects into cells and their accuracy is effectively controllable by the number of cells. Both approximations lend themselves readily to an adaptive adjustment of the number of cells in order to assure the required level of accuracy (see 4.2). At the same time, the combination of the approximations is such that linear as well as angular momentum are preserved. For an infinite number of cells, the continuous limit is attained and the way to calculate the forces and torques used in our method coincides with the above-mentioned equivalent magnetic dipole method. The first group mainly comprises ferromagnets with a strong remanence, i.e., residual magnetism. Since we assume the magnetized objects to be uncharged,  electric fields can be neglected. For a given current distribution J we define the associated magnetic moment m as The leading term of the magnetic induction for a magnetic moment m located at position r O reads with n = (r ? r O )/|r ? r O |. The distribution described by this expression is usually called the field of a dipole. For the special case of a sphere with homogeneous magnetization M = 1 2 [r ? J(r)], (4) represents the exact solution for all r. For i = 1 . N magnetic moments m i located at positions r i However, for finite N , this superposition can be used to effectively calculate the magnetic induction with controllable accuracy. Assuming that an object with magnetization M and volume V is subdivided into N cells with a fraction of the volume V /N , each of the cells carries a magnetic moment MV /N . Accordingly, with growing number of cells, the range of validity is increased to smaller and smaller distances from the object. At the same time, the subdivision into cells together with the linear superposition (5) allows for an inhomogeneous magnetization as well as for complex geometries of the objects under consideration. The convergence of the total magnetic induction with increasing number of cells is demonstrated in Fig. 3 . For this figure, a cuboidal test object with a homogeneous magnetization has been used. neous magnetization. The number of cells in x/y direction used for the calculation is indicated in the upper left corner of each figure. The shade of the vectors is proportional to their magnitude. For distances in the range of the spatial extent of the object, a few cells are already sufficient for a very good accuracy. If a current distribution is subject to an external magnetic field, both forces and torques are exerted according to Amp?re?s law. The leading terms can be obtained by a Taylor series expansion of the magnetic induction around the center of the current distribution. The lowest non-vanishing terms in the expansion of the force and torque on the magnetic moment m are The total force and torque acting on a magnetized object, considered as an aggregate of M magnetic dipoles cells, can now be determined: plugging the magnetic induction (5) into (6) and (7), we find explicit expressions for the resulting force F k acting on the magnetic moment m k of a single cell located at position r k , which is placed in the field of the N cells of another object with corresponding magnetic moments m i located at positions r i , Note that with increasing distance, force decreases more rapidly than torque, by a factor of 1/|r k ? r i |. M ) and summed up appropriately. For the total force, the positions of the cells r k relative to the center of mass of the object have to be respected in the summation. In the continuous limit M ? ?, the force and the torque coincide with the expressions of the equivalent magnetic dipole method and the exact solution is obtained. However, the calculation of the total force and torque gives accurate and reliable results even with a small number of cells per object. This section gives a detailed interpretation of all terms involved in (8) and (9) and also shows how to prove preservation of linear and angular momenta. The reader can safely skip this part when reading the paper for the first time. In order to illustrate the contribution of the different terms of the expressions for the force (8) and torque (9) we investigate six exemplary arrangements of two bar magnets depicted in Fig. 4 . For this illustration, the bar magnets are modeled as simple magnetic dipoles with a single cell. Only the force and torque terms acting on the second bar magnet are listed in the following; the ones acting on the first one follow from interchanging m 1 and m 2 and inverting n 12 = ?n 21 . In the first arrangement A1 , the two bar magnets are aligned in parallel and positioned side by side. The first term of (8) vanishes since both (m 2 ? n 12 ) and (m 1 ? n 12 ) vanish. The second term of (8) (proportional to 3n 12 (m 2 ? m 1 )) contributes (yellow arrow in the sketch, labeled 2 ). The third term of (8) vanishes for the same reason as the first one. The first term of (9) vanishes since (m 1 ? n 12 ) vanishes, and the second term of (9) vanishes since m 2 ? m 1 = 0. Accordingly, the only relevant contribution is given by the second term of the expression for the force and the total force is repulsive. In the second arrangement A2 , we encounter the same situation as in A1 , this time with an antiparallel alignment.Consequently, the total force, given by the second term of the expression (8), is attractive. The situation in the fourth arrangement B2 is the same as in B1 , but with m 2 reversed. The torque comes into play in the last two arrangements C1 and C2 . Here, only the third term of the force (8) contributes. The first term of the torque (9), which is proportional to 3(m 2 ? n 12 )(m 1 ? n 12 ), acts only on m 1 (labeled 4 ). The second term of (9) contributes for both m 1 and m 2 and is proportional to ?(m 2 ? m 1 ) (labeled 5 ). The reversion of m 2 from C1 to C2 leads to a changing of the sign of all contributions. In C2 , the total torque also tends to align the two bar magnets, but in the opposite direction. From these illustrations, we see that the sum of all forces vanishes in all arrangements shown here. For the sum of all torques, this is less obvious. The general case will be discussed subsequently. It should be stressed that the approximations for the magnetic induction, forces and torques are formulated in such a way that both linear and angular momentum are preserved. To prove the conservation, it has to be shown that both the total force and the total torque (summed over all cells of all objects) vanish. For the total force, this can easily be seen from (8) by interchanging m k and m i as well as their positions. Then, the force acting on m k is exactly the negative of the force acting on m i and the sum of the two vanishes. For the total torque, the derivation involves both forces and torques. The third term of the force (8) as well as the torque (9) contribute to the total torque. Permanent magnets, the first group of materials covered in the present work, are usually ferromagnets with a strong remanence or residual magnetism. More precisely, their constitutive relation between B and H is given by a hysteresis curve B[H] which exhibits a large remanent value of B for vanishing H. This implies that these materials feature a strong permanent magnetization even after the removal of the (strong) magnetic field used in order to magnetize them. As a second implication, the magnetic field of other magnetic objects, usually much weaker than the field used for the excitation of the permanent magnetization, does not change their magnetization considerably. In the present work, we assume the magnetization of the permanently magnetized objects to be constant (hard ferromagnets). This group includes diamagnets, paramagnets as well as ferromagnets with a  weak remanence. For the most common diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials, however, the absolute value of the susceptibility is of the order of 10 ?6 and the resulting magnetization as well as the forces and torques are very weak. As mentioned above, ferromagnets have to be described by a hysteresis curve connecting B and H. Nevertheless, for the special case of ferromagnets with a weak remanence (soft ferromagnets) subject to weak external magnetic fields, a linear approximation in the form of (10) with ? > 0 is adequate. In the case of soft ferromagnets, the magnetic susceptibility varies by several orders of magnitude. In general, the magneto-static Maxwell equations (1) and (2) have to be solved together with the constitutive relation, i.e., (10) in the present case. Fortunately, if we subdivide the objects with an induced magnetization into cells and approximately assume the cells to be spherical, an explicit solution is accessible. Additionally neglecting the coupling between the cells, we obtain an explicit expression for the induced magnetization M i of a cell located at position r i : In the present work, we use (5) to compute the magnetic induction due to permanently magnetized objects. Accordingly, a paramagnet is attracted by a permanent magnet, whereas a diamagnet is repelled. Soft ferromagnets with ? > 0 behave like paramagnets, but the resulting force and torque are much stronger due to the usually much higher value of ?. Superconductors expel any external magnetic field from their interior ? a phenomenon called Mei?ner-Ochsenfeld effect. The expulsion of the external magnetic field is achieved by screening currents flowing on the surface of the superconducting material. In the interior of the superconductor, these screening currents generate a magnetic field which exactly balances the external one. Thus, in a very simple physical picture, the magnetic induction vanishes completely inside the superconductor, B = 0. Combining the vanishing magnetic induction with (2), we find M = ?H inside the superconductor (perfect diamagnetism). Because of the strong induced magnetization which is oriented anti-parallel to the magnetic induction, superconductors are repelled from permanent magnets. This section describes some implementational aspects of our method including the computation of magnetic force and torque as well as the adaptive cell hierarchy. Algorithm 1 provides an overview of the steps involved in the computation of magnetic force and torque. This amounts to evaluating the magnetic field of all permanent magnets in the scene at the induced magnets? cell positions (l.3). Note that the bound for the second loop (l.7) is different due to the symmetry of magnetic interaction. For every pair of magnets, we compute force and torque exerted by all cells of one object onto all cells of the other object and vice versa according to (8) and (9) (ll.11-12). Algorithm 1 Magnetic force and torque computation 1: //Compute magnetization for induced magnets 2: for all induced magnets do 3: computeInducedMagnetization(); 4: end for 5: //Compute magnetic force and torque 6: for i = 1 to n mag do 7: for j = i to n mag do 8: for k = 1 to n cells,i do 9: for l = 1 to n cells,j do 10: c k =cell(k), c l = cell(l); 11: applyForce(i,c k ,c l ), applyTorque(i,c k , c l ); 12: applyForce(j,c l ,c k ), applyTorque(j,c l , c k ); 13: end for 14: end for 15: end for 16: end for\n          Once forces and torques between two dipoles are computed, they can either be fed directly into the RBD solver (ll.11-12) or be accumulated first. The latter is typically more efficient, especially in a parallel implementation where thread-safety of the RBD code might be an issue. The actual parallelization is simple and efficient since all operations for one iteration are independent of other iterations. For reasonable magnetization densities, the forces can be safely time stepped using explicit integration, since the distance between two dipole cells cannot fall below one cell diameter and the force is thus limited. Fortunately, we can exploit the controllable accuracy of magnetic induction (5), force (8) and torque (9). For this purpose, we use an adaptive multi-resolution cell hierarchy as described next. As indicated in Section 3, a higher cell density increases the approximation quality of field, force and torque. The following observation is key to our adaptive strategy: the magnetic field B(r) of a dipole is proportional to 1/r 3 , r being the distance to the dipole. The remainder of this section describes the adaptive framework that builds upon this measure. The hierarchy for an object is created starting with a single cell at level zero, corresponding to its bounding box. A cell itself has only volume and no shape but we associate with it the bounding box of the geometry that it represents. We prefer bisection over octasection as it leads to slower growth in the number of cells per level. If we find that a newly created cell lies completely outside the object, it is immediately discarded. This value can be determined using, e.g., Fig. 6 which indicates that for an interobject distance of 0.5 cm it is sufficient to have eight cells per cubic centimeter. Subsequently, we eliminate all those leaf cells whose positions (i.e., their mid-points) lie outside the object or which are closer to the object boundary than half their diameter. Finally, we rescale all cell magnetizations (using the same factor) such that their sum matches the total magnetization of the original object. This step is necessary to guarantee that force and torque computations are consistent among the levels: for sufficiently large distances, a dipole will thus experience the same force and torque from any level of a magnetized object. Cell Front As mentioned in Section 4.1, force, torque and field are always computed for pairs of magnets. Given such a pair, we have to select a resolution level based on the geometric distance between the two objects. Using a single hierarchy level would mean fixing cell density throughout the entire objects, which is very inefficient if only small regions are close, but large parts are far away from each other (see Fig. 5 , bottom). Instead we compute an adapted cell sampling or cell front for each of the two objects as follows: starting with the top level cell of one object, we first determine the distance that would be sufficiently large for the current cell density ? c = 1/v c , with v c being the current cell?s volume. By construction we have ? 0 /? c = r c 3 /r 0 3 and, hence, the sufficiently large distance is r c = 3 ? ? 0 c r 0 . We then check whether the geometric distance d of the cell to the other object is smaller than r c . To this end, we first check the corresponding bounding spheres for intersection. The current cell density is sufficient if d >= r. Otherwise, we apply the same process recursively to all children of the current cell until a sufficient density is reached. The result of this process is a cell front for every object, which reflects the continuous geometric distance to the other object (see Fig. 5 ). Note that the hierarchy needs only be constructed once at the beginning of the simulation. Analytical Comparison In order to verify its validity, we apply our method to a test configuration consisting of two cube-shaped ferromagnets with volume V = (1cm) 3 exhibiting a homogeneous remanent magnetic induction B r of 1 Tesla (see Fig. 6 ). Using (2), the corresponding magnetization is found to be M = B r /? 0 . This test configuration has been used in [de Medeiros et al. 1998] for the comparison of several of the aforementioned alternative force calculation methods. An analytical solution for this case has been presented in [Akoun and Yonnet 1984]. Since this solution is based on equivalent magnetic charges, which are located on the surface, it is valid only for finite distances d > 0. By contrast, our method is also valid for the contact case, i.e., d = 0, since the magnetic dipoles cells are always located in the interior of the objects. The results shown in Fig. 6 were obtained using N 3 uniformly distributed cells for each cube. For the fixed distance of d = 0.5 cm used in [de Medeiros et al. 1998], our method reproduces the correct result for the attractive force already with a very low number of cells. For lower distances, the results of our method converge to the exact solution as the number of cells is increased. The results for the total force as given in Fig. 6 further emphasize the usefulness of adaptivity: for close proximity a high cell resolution is mandatory in order to obtain good accuracy. However, the number of cells necessary for maintaining good approximation quality rapidly decreases with growing inter-object distance. Additionally, it also provides a simple way to check the implementation. For testing purposes, linear and angular momentum are readily computed during the simulation. If the implementation is correct, the sum of both quantities over all objects has to be time-invariant. Comparison of the total force calculated using our method with exact results for a test configuration consisting of two ferromagnetic cubes with homogeneous magnetization. With increasing number of cells per object, (given by N 3 with N as indicated), the results for the force converge to the exact solution. We verified this for our code on a number of simulations and obtained very good conservation behavior for the frictionless and noncontact case. During and after contact situations, the conservation deteriorates even for completely elastic collisions. This section presents some exemplary results obtained with our method. For our implementation we used the freely available RBD library ODE [Smith 2006]. Many of our examples use toy magnets, consisting of a plasticcoated cylinder with two small permanent magnets at the ends (see Figs. 1, 2, 7 and accompanying video). The magnetic field of a toy magnet is visualized in Fig. 1 . Examples The example shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates the effect of inhomogeneous induced magnetization. A magnetized sphere is held in contact with a toy magnet, while a second toy magnet is placed at some distance. Similarly, the sphere is magnetized homogeneously (identical direction) according to the external field and attracts the left toy magnet as well. In the second and more interesting case, the toy magnets have opposite magnetizations leading to a point of zero resulting magnetic field, clearly distinguishable in the left-most figure of the bottom row. Initially, the sphere assumes the magnetization of the right toy magnet, to which it is attached. As the left toy magnet is gradually moved to the right, its magnetic field starts to induce a corresponding magnetization in the sphere, resulting in a directionally inhomogeneous magnetization. However, the left toy magnet is still repelled from the right one. Forcing it to move further rightwards, the repelling forces increase but, at the same time, the attracting field induced in the sphere grows up to the point, where the resulting attraction forces exceed the repelling forces and the toy magnet snaps to the sphere. This fascinating effect, which can be thought of as passing a potential barrier, is clearly perceptible in reality and faithfully reproduced by our method. Note that, although the final geometries of the top and bottom sequences are identical, the resulting fields exhibit subtle local differences. The next test case shows another example for complex behavior obtained with multiple induced magnets. Fig. 7 shows a sequence of four images taken from a simulation of a permanent magnet lifting several soft-ferromagnetic spheres out of a bowl. As the permanent magnet is moved downwards it starts to induce a magnetization in the spheres. At a certain distance, one of the spheres is picked up by the permanent magnet (see upper two images of Fig. 7 ). Subsequently, the other spheres are further drawn towards the magnet and are lifted as well. Finally, five spheres are attached to the permanent magnet and lifted above the bowl (lower two figures). In the final position, only one of the spheres is directly attached to the permanent magnet whereas the other four spheres are hanging below the first one forming a symmetric configuration. As can be seen in the accompanying video the same behavior can be observed in a real-world experiment. In two further examples we demonstrate that our method is capable of handling a large number of objects as well as magnets with arbitrary non-convex geometry. Fig. 8 shows a sequence of images from a simulation in which a rectangular permanent magnet lifts four soft-ferromagnetic characters out of a pool of non-magnetic spheres. Fig. 9 shows an image of a scene in which 250 soft-ferromagnetic spheres are dropped onto a simple dragon model. As soon as they approach the dragon, a magnetization is induced in the spheres and they start to interact magnetically with each other and the dragon. According to (12), the induced magnetization exactly balances the external field and can thus be of considerable strength. With a sufficiently strong magnetization of the ferromagnet the repelling forces on the superconductor can be large enough to overcome gravity. The simulation shown in Fig. 10 consists of a ferromagnetic ring and a superconducting cube levitating above it. The toroidal shape of the ferromagnet leads to an equilibrium position above the center of the ring for the superconducting cube. As can be seen in the right hand side image of Fig. 10 , the ferromagnetic ring is magnetized in the vertical direction. In two points above and below the center of the ring, the magnetic field vanishes. Since the superconductor is repelled from the field, positions close to these two points are energetically favorable. Once put into the upper of the two, the superconducting cube remains in this stable position. From the right hand side image of Fig. 10 , one can see that the field lines are repelled from the interior of the superconductor and literally flow around it. This is the Mei?ner-Ochsenfeld effect mentioned above. Apart from dynamic simulation, our method can also be used as a tool for computing magnetic fields for arbitrary objects. Using this technique, we can visually discover such fascinating aspects of magnetic fields as, e.g., the relation between field structure and geometric shape (see Fig. 11 ). The computational impact of our method is determined by the number of cells used to compute magnetic force and torque. Compared to the worst case performance, which scales quadratically with the number of cells, the average run time is greatly reduced using the adaptive sampling described in section 4.2. For the examples described above, the average reduction in computation time due to adaptivity ranges from 1.3 for the scene described in Fig. 2 to 11.1 for the simulation shown in Fig. 9 . Table 1 summarizes computation times for the examples used in this work, showing total computation times and the time spent for computing magnetic forces and torques. To allow easier interpretation we report the computation times without any parallelization, although many parts of the algorithm lend themselves to easy parallelization strategies and our first results showed nearly optimal speedup on a workstation with four CPUs. As expected, computing the magnetic interaction takes up most of the simulation time. Still, simulations with dozens of magnets and up to several hundreds of cells run at interactive rates. Limitations Our treatment of induced magnetization is approximate as we do not account for the fact that induced fields act back on the external field. The correct treatment of the problem requires a solution of the Maxwell equations including boundary conditions. A solution could be to reiterate the magnetic field computation, including induced fields, until convergence. Our first experiments in this direction indicated that additional effort is necessary to ensure convergence, which seems very sensitive to the strength of the magnetic field as well as the magnetic susceptibility of the material. Also, the dipole approximation is a possible point of improvement when considering the mutual influence of the induced magnets. the total number of cells in the scene and Gain denotes the speed-up for magnetic force computations due to adaptivity, which was used in all examples. TST is the scene described in Fig. 2 with two toy magnets and a soft-ferromagnetic sphere. BowlSpheres is the simulation shown in Fig. 7 . Bowl2008 is shown in Fig. 8 , SuperCube refers to the simulation of a superconducting cube shown in Fig. 10 . DragonLow and DragonHigh are simulations of a magnetic dragon model and 250 soft-ferromagnetic spheres ( Fig. 9 ) using different cell resolutions. Our method preserves linear and angular momenta, but this does not imply energy conservation for which a theoretical analysis is difficult because of the energy accumulated in the magnetic field. The rigid body solver used in our implementation does not preserve energy, which is why we did not try to assess this behavior experimentally. It would therefore be interesting to carry out further tests using, e.g., symplectic solvers [Hairer et al. 2006], which are known for their excellent energy preservation behavior. This would for example allow to model a virtual electric motor and simulate the interplay of electric, mechanical and magnetic parts. Finally, with hindsight to educational applications, the integration of a haptic interface would further increase the usefulness of our method. We would like to thank Markus Huber for helping us with the examples and Christian Gr?nzweig for providing us with literature. Furthermore, we thank Eitan Grinspun for valuable comments and for helping us to revise and restructure the exposition. Finally, we thank the reviewers for many helpful comments and ideas. and Electronic Engineering 20, 2, 431?447. G ILBERT , E. G., J OHNSON , D. W., AND K EERTHI , S. S. 1988.
